&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A man went to see his doctor one day because he was suffering from pains in his stomach. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After the doctor had examined him carefully, he said to him, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Well, there's nothing really wrong with you, I'm glad to say. Your only trouble is that you worry too much. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you know, I had a man with the same trouble as you in here a few weeks ago, and I gave him the same advice as I'm going to give you. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was worried because he couldn't pay his tailor's bills. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I told him not to worry his head about the bills any more. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He followed my advice, and when he came to see me again two days ago, he told me that he now feels quite all right again." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yes, I know all about that," answered the patient sadly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You see, I'm that man's tailor." </T> <BR>
