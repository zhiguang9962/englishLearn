      <strong>Text A</strong><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A farmer who lived in a small village suffered from a  
      severe pain in the chest. This never seemed to get any better. The farmer  
      eventually decided that he would consult a doctor in the nearest town. But  
      as he was a miserly person he thought he would find out what he would have  
      to pay this doctor. He was told that a patient had to pay three pounds for  
      the first visit and one pound for the second' visit. The farmer thought  
      about this for a long time, and then he decided to go and consult the  
      doctor in the town.</font></p> 
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he came into the doctor's consulting room, he said  
      causally,&acute; Good morning, doctor. Here I am again.' The doctor was a  
      little surprised. He asked him a few questions, examined his chest and  
      then took the pound which the farmer insisted on giving him. Then the  
      doctor said with a smile , Well , sir. There's nothing new. Please  
      continue to take the same medicine I gave you the first time you came to  
      see me.'<br> 
      <br>

      <strong>Text B</strong><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man went to see his doctor one day because he was  
      suffering from pains in his stomach. After the doctor had examined him  
      carefully, he said to him, `Well, there's nothing really<br> 
      wrong with you, I'm glad to say. Your only trouble is that you worry too  
      much.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Do you know, I had a man with the same trouble as you in here a few  
      weeks ago, and I gave him the same advice as I'm going to give you. He was  
      worried because he couldn't pay his tailor's bills. I told him not to  
      worry his head about the bills any more. He followed my advice, and when  
      he came to see me again two days ago, he told me that he now feels quite  
      all right again. '<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; `Yes, I know all about that,' answered the patient sadly.`You  
      see , I'm that man's tailor.'</font></p>
