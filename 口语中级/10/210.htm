      How to Describe Yourself<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      All about me<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm twelve years old. I'm large for my age and have big 
      feet which I am self-conscious about. I look like both my mum and my dad 
      but in different ways. I have fair hair and blue eyes like my dad, and a 
      mouth an'd expression like my mum. My nose is like my mother's and 
      definitely nothing like my father's ( 'thank oodness'). I am very like my 
      mum in temperament, though I don't have her very hot temper.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm rather a tomboy but I'm not violent. I hate 
      fighting and arguments. I hate being laughed at and some teasing hurts me 
      more than I show. I tend to sulk when I am annoyed and I tend to be a bit 
      oversensitive. Friendship is important to me with people of all ages. My 
      home is very important to me and I would hate to be sent to a boarding 
      school. On the whole I'm a fairly tidy persorl.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite creative with my hands. I like making models 
      , pendants and candles as well as other things. I like acting and music, I 
      play the French horn and can play the trumpet. I am not a very keen reader 
      because I like to be outside most of the time. I ride my bike a lot and 
      have been youth hosteling with it. My father lives abroad and I enjoy 
      travelling to see him. I enjoy my food (especially my French grandmother 
      as she is an excellent cook! ) and I have a sweet tooth but I hate the 
      dentist. I don't like my hair being brushed by someone else and I hate it 
      long.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the one thing I really find boring is homework 
      as I would far rather be outside or make something.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      My thoughts<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes wonder what my mind is like inside, often I 
      fancy that it is like this. I feel as if my mind goes round and round like 
      the earth and if my lessons make me think hard it begins to spin. In my 
      other class it was getting all stodgy and still and lumpy and rusty. I 
      feel as if there is a ball in my mind and it is divided into pieces -each 
      piece stands for a different mood.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">The ball turns 
      every now and then and that's what makes me change moods. I have my 
      learning mood, my goodlooks mood, my happy mood, my loose-end mood and my 
      grumpy mood, my miserable mood, my thoughtful mood and my planning mood. 
      At the moment I am writing this I am in my thoughtful mood.When I am in my 
      thoughtful mood I think out my maths and plan stories and poems. When my 
      kitten is in her thoughtful mood she thinks shall I pounce or not, and 
      shall I go to sleep or not. This sort of thing goes on in my own mind, 
      too. It is very hard for me to put my thoughts into words.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (1)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's the sort of chap who loves to make entrances and 
      exits. He'll arrive ten minutes before everybody else and he'll leave ten 
      minutes before everybody else. He'll come dashing in with a bunch of 
      flowers, screaming hellos. He likes to be noticed. He loves telling jokes. 
      He's a well-informed chap and keeps up to date with all the current 
      affairs. He likes to talk and give his view on life .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;He's very 
      successful. When he sets himself a goal, he works hard to attain that and 
      to achieve it. He knows what he wants and he'll set out to get it. As a 
      result, he's successful. When you're talking to Roger, sometimes you're 
      left way, way behind. His mind is whizzing over so fast that you're 
      talking about something, and he's off at a tangent,talking about something 
      completely different. He can't sit down. He's not. He can't relax. He's 
      always jumping up and doing things and finds it hard to concentrate at 
      times.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (2)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gazes at.herself in wonder. Vanished are her 
      healthy pink cheeks, her slightly red winter nose, her mole, her little 
      freckles and blemishes; she is smooth, new made. She dabs a little powder 
      on top, and stands back to admire the effect. It is pleasing, she decides. 
      She wonders what it will look like by midnight. Will she be transformed 
      imo an uneven, red-faced, patchy, blotchy clown? An ugly sister?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (3)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a 
      Christmas party, a young man from the Erewash Valley. Morel was then 
      twenty-seven years old. He was well set-up, erect, and very smart. He had 
      wavy black hair that shone again, and a vigorous black beard that had 
      never been shaved. His cheeks were ruddy, and his red, moist mouth was 
      noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">He had that rare 
      thing, a rich, ringing laugh. Gertrude Coppard had watched him, 
      fascinated. He was so full of colour and animation, his voice ran so 
      easily into comic grotesque, he was so ready and so pleasant with 
      everybody. Her own father had a rich fund of humour,but it was satiric. 
      This man's was different: soft, non-intellectual, warm, a kind of 
      gambolling.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She herself was opposite. She had a curious, receptive 
      mind which' found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk. 
      She was clever in leading folk to talk. She loved ideas, and was 
      considered very intellectual. What she liked most of all was an argument 
      on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man. This she did 
      not often enjoy. So she always had people tell her about themselves, 
      finding her pleasure so.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her person she was rather small and delicate, with a 
      large brow, and dropping bunches of brown silk curls. Her blue eyes were 
      very straight, honest,and searching. She had the beautiful hands of the 
      Coppards. Her dress was always subdued. She wore dark blue silk, with a 
      peculiar silver chain of silver scallops. This, and a heavy brooch of 
      twisted gold, was her only ornament. She was still perfectly intact, 
      deeply religious, and full of beautiful candour.<br>
