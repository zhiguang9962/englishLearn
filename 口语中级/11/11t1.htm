&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> You and your family have been living in the same six-family apartment building for eight years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The landlord's family also lives there, and, generally speaking, all the tenants get along fairly well with each other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Recently, however, there was a change in the apartment next to yours. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A nice, quiet old couple used to live there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The old lady would sometimes bring over some cookies or small cakes she had made, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and your mother in return would give them some food or help the old woman with her shopping. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Unfortunately, the old lady died last month. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her husband couldn't live alone, so his grandson moved in with him. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The grandson, who is about twenty, has become a problem to your family. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You are used to peace and quiet, but the grandson likes to listen to his radio late at night. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sometimes friends of his visit, and they make a lot of noise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everyone in your family is bothered by your new neighbor and as a result is becoming more irritated. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Your mother once politely asked the old man if he was able to sleep well at night, but apparently he didn't get the hint. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If he did understand your mother's intention and did speak to his grandson about it, the grandson apparently didn't listen, since things haven't changed any. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everyone in your family agrees that something has to be done, but no one wants to hurt the old man's feelings or cause him any problems. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What do you think should be done? </T> <BR>
