      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You and your family have been living in the same 
      six-family apartment building for eight years. The landlord's family also 
      lives there, and, generally speaking,all the tenants get along fairly well 
      with each other. Recently, however, there was a change in the apartment 
      next to yours.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nice, quiet old couple used to live there. The old 
      lady would sometimes bring over some cookies or small cakes she had made, 
      and your mother in return would give them some food or help the old woman 
      with her shopping. Unfortunately, the old lady died last month. Her 
      husband couldn't live alone, so his grandson moved in with him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grandson, who is about twenty, has become a problem 
      to your family. The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. You 
      are used to peace and quiet, but the grandson likes to listen to his radio 
      late at night. Sometimes friends of his visit, and they make a lot of 
      noise. Everyone in your family is bothered by your new neighbor and as a 
      result is becoming more irritated.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your mother once politely asked the old man if he was 
      able to sleep well at night , but apparently he didn't get the hint. If he 
      did understand your mother's intention and did speak to his grandson about 
      it, the grandson apparently didn't listen, since things haven't changed 
      any. Everyone in your family agrees that something has to be done, but no 
      one wants to hurt the old man's feelings or cause him any problems.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think should be done?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of day is about 7. 30 in the evening. You are 
      on your way home and are presently on a subway train which is about full. 
      At one of the stops , a young man in his eaily twenties gets on the train 
      and sits down next to a middle-aged woman reading a book.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">The man looks 
      like he might have been drinking a little. After a few minutes, he 
      reaches,into his pocket for a cigarette and lights up. There are signs on 
      the subway which prohibit smoking.People usually obey the signs , since it 
      is both dangerous and inconsiderate not to. The woman turri~ to the man 
      and very politely says, &quot;Excusc me, sir, but you aren't supposed to 
      smoke on the subway. &quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">The man ignores 
      her, so she once again says. &quot;Excuse me, sir, but people don't 
      usually smoke on the subway. &quot; The man looks at the woman and says, 
      &quot;Why don't you mind your own business,lady?&quot; The woman closes 
      her book, very calmly stands up, looks straight at the man and says, 
      &quot;I think the safety of all the passengers is everyone's business, 
      young man. &quot; She then turns tc walk away, when suddenly the young man 
      jumps up and grabs her by the arm and turns her around. The woman yells.<br>
