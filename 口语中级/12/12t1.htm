&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If someone offered to pay all my expenses for a month's holiday anywhere in the world, I would feel very surprised and very excited. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It would be difficult to decide where I wanted to go. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Should I go to one place or to lots of different places? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If I went to one country, I could see and understand a lot about it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If I went to lots of countries, my holiday would be more interesting and more exciting. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think I would decide to fly around the world and to visit three different countries. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The countries I would visit would be Australia, the United States of America and Kenya. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If I went to Australia, I would stay there for about two weeks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I am sure it would be very interesting to visit a country which is so very different from my own. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Before I went, I would write to one of my Australian friends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I would suggest that if it were possible, he should spend a week with me visiting Aboriginal tribes in the northern part of Australia. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I would really like to find out how the Aboriginal people live in Australia today. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My friend could explain what we saw and he could translate what people said because he majored in Aboriginal Studies at Queensland University. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> While I was visiting Australia, I hope I could also see some of the large cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If I went to the United States, I would stay there about a week. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I expect I would start by visiting New York. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have heard that New York is a very exciting city. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I imagine that there are lots of tourist attractions, that the buildings are spectacular and that the food is very varied. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After I had stayed two or three days in New York, I would fly to San Francisco. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I hope I could stay with my relations who live there and I would visit the city and other parts of California. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Finally, I would fly to Kenya where I would stay for about a week. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are three things I would like to do in Kenya. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> First, I hope I could visit the coast because I would like to see the old Arab cities and enjoy the beautiful beaches. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Next, I would like to visit a Game Reserve. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I imagine the wild animals of Africa ¡ª the lion, elephant and hippopotamus ¡ª are very exciting and beautiful. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Finally, I would like to visit the Mountains of Kenya where you can see snow on the Equator. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If someone offered me this money, I would be amazed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Unfortunately, I do not think this will ever happen and I doubt if I shall ever visit these countries. </T> <BR>
