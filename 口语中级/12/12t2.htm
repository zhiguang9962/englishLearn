&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Ann started work last summer, so she didn't have a holiday. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She saved as much as she could and, in January, she booked a package trip to Rosas, in Spain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She left London airport early on the morning of the first Saturday in August. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was very excited, as this was her first trip abroad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> During the flight they had a snack, and when they arrived at Barcelona airport, a special bus was ready to take them to their hotel in Rosas. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The weather was beautiful and Ann enjoyed the bus trip. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> At the hotel, she checked in, and then went to her room to change before dinner. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was just ready to go downstairs, when she found that her Spanish money wasn't in her handbag. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She carefully looked in all her luggage, but she couldn't find it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All she had was a small purse with ten English pound notes in it! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Ann found a place to change her English money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She had very few pesetas, and she would be here for two weeks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On her way back to the hotel, Ann bought some cheese, some bread and some oranges. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she got back, she told the manager that her doctor had told her not to eat Spanish food; she'd just have breakfast each day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This was all right, as she knew the price of hotels included breakfast. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For the rest of her holiday, Ann swam in the hotel swimming-pool, or lay on the beach and got a suntan. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She also went for long walks with one of the other tourists, a Scottish girl called Jane. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> However, when the others went to interesting places, she always said she wasn't well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In fact, her holiday wasn't bad, except that she was always hungry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After all, a piece of fruit for lunch, and bread and cheese for supper isn't very much ... especially not for two weeks! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Late in the afternoon of their last day, Ann and Jane were on the beach. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Jane asked her why she never ate with them in the hotel restaurant. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The food was excellent. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ann told her all about her money problems. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Jane looked at her for a minute, and then said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "But didn't you know? The price of this holiday includes absolutely everything!" </T> <BR>
