&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'm forty and married with two children. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My trouble is that I haven't got enough to do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The kids are at school all day and the house is empty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So I eat chocolates, mostly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've put on a lot of weight, but I can't give them up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I try as hard as I can but I just can't stop eating. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Doctor Bruce writes: I think Mrs. Allen would be happier if she found a job, or if she got out of the house more and made some interesting friends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If she did that, I think the weight problem would be solved. </T> <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'm sixteen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My trouble is my spotty skin. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've used all the creams on the market, but none of them do any good. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And now I've met a marvellous girl. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I'm afraid to ask her to go out with me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Doctor Bruce writes: Most teenagers suffer from this, of course, at some time or other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And it makes them very shy and self-conscious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "What will other people think of me, if they see me like this?" they wonder. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And it's a pity, because if they didn't worry so much, the skin trouble would soon disappear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Tom should learn a relaxation technique, yoga for example. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then I think he'd solve the problem very quickly. </T> <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My problem is time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I haven't enough of it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I sleep badly, and I wake up tired. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I get indigestion every day and now I'm beginning to get bad headaches and pains in my chest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And don't tell me to take a holiday, doctor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I haven't got time. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Doctor Bruce writes: If Mr. Tyler had more common sense, he'd find the time to have a holiday, or change his job. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If he thought for a minute, he'd see that he can't go on like this. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He should rest more. Then he'd work better. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But that's the silly thing about men like him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They only believe they're ill when they're almost dead. </T> <BR>
