<T TYPE=SEN> Dear Doctor: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I am forty-seven years old, male, and of average height and weight. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My health generally seems quite good except for one problem. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wake up every morning feeling tired ¡ª so tired that I can hardly get out of bed. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> All day at work I fight this tired feeling, just dragging myself around. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I get home from work around 5:30, I have a good dinner with my family and then sit down to read the newspaper. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But before I have finished reading the front page, I fall asleep in my chair and often sleep until 8:30 or 9:00 p.m. </T>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When I wake up from this nap, I feel wonderful. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm full of energy and ready to do a day's work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But at that hour there is nothing to do but watch television, which I do until after midnight. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Even at midnight I still do not feel sleepy, but I know I ought to get a good night's rest, so I take a sleeping pill and go to bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's often two o'clock in the morning before the pill puts me to sleep. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just a few hours after that I have to drag myself out of bed again to go to work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All day I feel too tired to work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I just drag myself around until it's time to go home. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Do you think there might be something wrong with my blood? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> J.T.L. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> <I>When this letter appeared in the DEAR DOCTOR column of a newspaper, the doctor's reply was printed below it. </I></T>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>Here is what the doctor answered: </I></T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Dear Mr. L.: </T>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I don't think there is anything wrong with your blood. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The key to your problem is that long nap after dinner. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If you didn't sleep for hours during the early part of the evening, you would be more ready to sleep at bedtime. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you didn't nap after dinner, you would not want to stay up so late, and you would not feel the need to take a sleeping pill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The pill is still working in your system when you get up in the morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This helps account for the fact that you feel tired all day. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> You should get out of the habit of sleeping during the evening. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Right after your evening meal, engage in some sort of physical activity ¡ª a sport such as bowling, perhaps. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Or get together with friends for an evening of cards and conversation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then go to bed at your usual time or a little earlier, and you should be able to get a good night's rest without taking a pill. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If you can get into the habit of spending your evenings this way, I am sure you will feel less tired during the day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first it may be hard for you to go to sleep without taking a pill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If so, get up and watch television or do some jobs around your house until you feel sleepy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you fall asleep and then wake up a few hours later, get up but do not take a sleeping pill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Read a while or listen to the radio, and make yourself a warm drink. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Eat a sandwich or a cookie. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then go back to bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even if you get only a few hour's sleep that night, you will feel better in the morning than you usually feel after taking a pill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The next night you will be ready to sleep at an earlier hour. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The most important thing is to avoid taking that nap right after dinner and to avoid taking pills. </T> <BR>
