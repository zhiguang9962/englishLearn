      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm forty and married with two children. My trouble is 
      that I haven't got enough to do. The kids are at school all day and the 
      house is empty. So I eat chocolates, mostly. I've put on a lot of weight , 
      but I can't give them up. I try as hard as I can but I just can't stop 
      eating.</font>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor Bruce writes : I think Mrs Allen would be 
      happier if she found a job, or if she got out of the house more and made 
      some interesting friends. If she did that, I think the weight problem 
      would be solved.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sixteen. My trouble is my spotty skin. I've used 
      all the creams on the market, but none of them do any good. And now I've 
      met a marvellous girl. But I'm afraid to ask her to go out with me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor Bruce writes: Most teenagers suffer from this, 
      of course, at some time or other. And it makes them very shy and 
      self-conscious. 'What will other people think of me, if they see me like 
      this?' they wonder. And it's a pity, because if they didn't worry so much, 
      the skin trouble would soon disappear. Tom should learn a relaxation 
      technique, yoga for example. Then I think he'd solve the problem very 
      quickly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My problem is time. I haven't enough of it. I sleep 
      badly, and I wake up tired. I get indigestion every day and now I'm 
      beginning to get bad headaches and pains in my chest. And don't tell me to 
      take a holiday, doctor. I haven't got time.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor Bruce writes ; If Mr Tyler had more common sense 
      ,he'd find the time to have a holiday, or change his job. If he thought 
      for a minute, he'd see that he can't go on like this. He should rest more. 
      Then he'd work better. But that's the silly thing about men like him. They 
      only believe they're ill when they're almost dead.</font></p>

      Text B<br>
      <br>
      Dear Doctor :<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am forty-seven years old, male, and of average height 
      and weight. My health generally seems quite good except for one problem. I 
      wake up every morning feeling tired-so tired that I can hardly get out of 
      bed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All day at work I fight this tired feeling, just 
      dragging myself around. When I get home from work around 5. 30, I have a 
      good dinner with my family and then sit dow n to read the newspaper. But 
      before I have finished reading the front page, I fall asleep in my chair 
      and often sleep until 8. 30 or 9. 00 p.m.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I wake up from this nap, I feel wonderful. I'm 
      full of energy and ready to do a day's work. But at that hour there is 
      nothing to do but watch television, which I do until after midnight.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at midnight I still do not feel sleepy, but I know 
      I ought to get a good night's rest, so I take a sleeping pill and go to 
      bed. It's often two o'clock in the morning before the pill puts me to 
      sleep. Just a few hours after that I have to drag myself out of bed again 
      to go to work. All day I feel too tired to work. I just drag myself around 
      until it's time to go home.<br>
      Do you think there might be something wrong with my blood?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      J. T. L.<br>
      When this letter appeared in the DEAR DOCTOR column of a newspaper, the 
      doctor's reply zeras printed belozo it. Here is mhat the doctor answered :<br>
      Dear Mr L. :</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think there is anything wrong with your blood. 
      The key to your problem is that long nap after dinner.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you didn't sleep for hours during the early part of 
      the evening, you would be more ready to sleep at bedtime. If you didn't 
      nap after dinner, you would not want to stay up so late, and you would not 
      feel the need to take a sleeping pill. The pill is still working in your 
      system when you get up in the morning. This helps account for the fact 
      that you feel tired all day.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should get out of the habit of sleeping during the 
      evening. Right after your evening meal, engage in some sort of physical 
      activity-a sport such as bowling, perhaps. Or get. together with friends 
      for an evening of cards and conversation. Then go to bed at `your usual 
      time or a little earlier, and you should be able to get a good night's 
      rest without taking a pill.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can get into the habit of spending your evenings 
      this way, I am sure you will feel less tired during the day. At first it 
      may be hard for you to go to sleep without taking a pill. If so,get up and 
      watch television or do some jobs around your house until you feel sleepy. 
      If you fall asleep and then wake up a few hours later, get up but do not 
      take a leeping pill.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Read a 
      while or listen to the radio, and make yourself a warm drink. Eat a 
      sandwich or a cookie. Then go back to bed. Even if you get only a few 
      hour's sleep that night, you will feel better, in the morning than you 
      usually feel after taking a pill. The next night you will be ready to 
      sleep at an earlier hour.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important thing is to avoid taking that nap 
      right after dinner and to avoid taking pills.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday's drizzle did not dampen Beijingers' 
      enthusiasm in events marking the first national dental care day.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People of all ages crowded around medical experts who 
      answered questions about dental care, and about toothbrushes and 
      toothpaste.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A girl in her 20's approached the consulting desk set 
      by the Oral Medical College of the Beijing University of Medical Sciences 
      at the Xidan crossroad. She wanted to know if there was anything wrong 
      with her teeth.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl dreamed about losing all her teeth , and , 
      worse yet , her teeth ached when she awoke every morning.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After examining her mouth, a consultant said her teeth 
      looked all right. Sometimes,however, tension makes peoples' teeth ache. 
      Relax, she was told. And if that does not help, get a thorough dental 
      examination.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young parents wanted to know how to keep their 
      children's teeth healthy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One by one , the doctors answered their questions and 
      outlined the best solutions for them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 500 medical specialists from 18 districts and 
      suburban counties across the municipality as well as over 200 teachers and 
      students from the Oral Medical College of the beijing University of 
      Medical Sciences took part in the sidewalk consultations.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And about 47 consulting stations were set up in major 
      streets and the four big department stores at downtown Xidan, Wangfujing, 
      Dongsi and the Dong'an Market.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to offering suggestions, the medical 
      workers also brought with them some simple medical equipment for fast 
      dental checks and toothpaste and toothbrushes for sale.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posters and propaganda blackboards were also set up in 
      most primary and middle schools in beijing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I never thought there would be so much scientific 
      knowledge on tooth brushing,&quot; said a middle-aged man. &quot;National 
      Dental Care day has taught me how important it is to take care of my teeth 
      and how to do it,&quot; he said. According to information from the 
      National Dental Diseases Prevention Group , similar activities were 
      conducted yesterday in most of the country's provinces, autonomous regions 
      and municipalities.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A massive campaign to teach people how to care 
      for their own teeth is the best way for China to deal with dental diseases 
      in the face of a shortage of dental medical workers,&quot; Chen Minzhang, 
      Minister of Public Health said on Tuesday at a symposium on dental care in 
      beijing Stomatological Hospital.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, almost half of the population is suffering 
      from dental caries (cavities).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the figure is even higher among children, 80 per 
      cent of urban children have dental caries and 60 per cent are so afflicted 
      in rural areas.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cities, the rate with children may reach as 
      high as more than 90 per cent.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister also pointed out that dental care should 
      be taught in primary and middle schools and the vast rural areas in order 
      to raise the whole nation's dental care standards.<br>
