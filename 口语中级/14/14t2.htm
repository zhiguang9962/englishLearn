&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Have you ever wondered how some people can break bricks with their bare hands? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People who can do this kind of thing are experts in Karate. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They are called "Karatekas". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Let's try to find out how karatekas could do such things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We wanted to learn if they were especially strong and we got some surprising answers! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Believe it or not, Karatekas aren't stronger than ordinary people ¡ª they just have more courage! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A Karate expert strikes hard objects like bricks or plates with the small bone in his wrist, opposite the thumb. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Speed is the essence of this sport. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the strange thing is that untrained men can break hard objects in the same way just as well as Karatekas. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course, Karatekas practise a lot and they have a layer of hard skin round their wrists. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Though they have this advantage over ordinary people, it's basically just a question of willpower at least, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> that's what you can tell your mother after you've experimented on a few dinner plates! </T> <BR>
