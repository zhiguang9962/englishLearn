      What Sports Do They Enjoy?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all people like to wnrk but everyone likes to play. 
      All over the world men and women and boys and girls enjoy sports. iends 
      the days of long ago, adults and children have called their friends 
      together to spend hours , even days , playing games.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sports help people to live happily. They help to keep 
      people healthy and feeling good. When they are playing games, people move 
      a lot. This is good for their health. I-Iaving fun with their friends 
      makes them happy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people enjoy sports by watching others play. In 
      small towns , crowds meet to watch the bicycle races or the soccer game.In 
      the big cities, thousands buy tickets to see an ice-skating show or a 
      baseball game.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What games have you played? What are your favorite 
      sports now? You probably play the games that people in your town or city 
      play. Is the climate hot where you live? Then swimming is probably one of 
      your sports. Boys and girls in Australia love tc swim. There are wonderful 
      beaches there and the weather is good for swimming.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Or do you live in 
      a cold climate? Then you would like to ski. There are many skiers in 
      Austria where there are big mountains and cold winters. Does it rain often 
      where you live? Then kite flying would not be one of your sports. It is 
      one of the favorite sports of Thailand.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surfing is an important sport in Hawaii. The Pacific 
      Ocean sends huge waves up on the beaches, waves that are just right for 
      surfing . But you need to live near an ocean to ride the waves and enjoy 
      surfing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People in Switzerland love to climb the wonderful 
      mountains of their country. Mountain climbing and hiking are favorite 
      sports there. But there can be no mountain climbing where tlmc re are no 
      mountains.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sposts change with the season. People often do not play 
      the same games in winter as in summer. Sailing is fun in warm weather, but 
      when it gets cold it's time to change to other sports. People talk about 
      sports' seasons. Baseball is only played for a few months of the year. 
      This is called &quot;the baseball<br>
      season&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever wondered how some people can break bricks 
      wi th their bare hands'? People who can do this kind of thing are experts 
      in Karate. They are called &quot;Karatekas&quot;. Let's try to f ind out 
      how karatekas could do such things. We wanted to learn i f they were 
      especially strong and we got some surprising answers!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Believe it or not 
      , Karatekas aren't stronger than ordinary nary people - they just have 
      more courage! A Karate expertstrikes hard objects like bricks or plates 
      with the small bone in his wrist , opposite the thumb. Speed is the 
      essence of this sport. But the strange thing is that untrained men can 
      break hard objects in the same way just as well as Karatekas.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Of course, 
      Karatekas practise a lot and they have a layer of hard skin round their 
      wrists. Though they have this advantage over ordinary people, it's 
      basically lust a qu5tion of willpower-at least , that's what you can tell 
      your mother afer you've experimentedon<br>
      a few dinner plates !<br>

      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The Football Match<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thi's is John Roberts reporting from Cardiff. The 
      result of the match which finished at four this afternoon between France 
      and Wales was a draw. Neither side scored. The Dutch referee did not allow 
      the one goal which France managed to kick. The reason for this was that a 
      French player was unfortunately off side. So both teams went .home 
      disappointed. This means that neither the French nor the Welsh team will 
      reach first place in this international competition.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I can say that the spectators were delighted 
      with the game. They particularly admired the French forwards, who were 
      always fast and often threatened the Welsh defence. Once it looked as 
      though the Welsh goalkeeper was in serious trouble.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;He dived to 
      his right to save a shot from the French centre forward and crashed his 
      head against the goal post. A doctor examined him but he soon began to 
      play again. Of course the large, friendly crowd applauded him. Wales will 
      certainly welcome another visit from this splendid team.<br>
