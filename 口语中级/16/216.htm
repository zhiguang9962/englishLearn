      How to Improve Your Study Habits<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you are an average student with an average 
      intellect.You pass most of your subjects. You occasionally get good 
      grades, but they are usually just average. You are more interested in 
      hiking than in history, and in sports than in scholarship. The fact is 
      that you don't study very much.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You probably think you will never be a top student. 
      This is not necessarily so, however. Anyone can become a better scholar if 
      he or she wants to. It is true that you may not be enthusiastic about 
      everything that you study, but by using your time properly you may improve 
      your grades without additional work. Here's how :</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Plan your time carefully. When you plan a trip, one 
      of the first things you must do is to make a list of things, to take. If 
      you don't you are almost certain to leave something important at home. 
      When you plan your week, you should make a list of things that you have to 
      do. Otherwise, you may forget to leave enough time to complete an 
      important task. After making the list, you should make a schedule of your 
      time.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">First fill in 
      committed time-eating, sleeping, dressing, school, meeting, ete. Then 
      decide on a good, regular time for studying. Be sure to set aside enough 
      time to complete the work that, you are normally assigned each week. Of 
      course , studying shouldn't occupy all of your free time. Don't forget to 
      set aside enough time for entertainment, hobbies , and maybe just 
      relaxation. A weekly schedule may not solve all your problems, but it will 
      force you to realize what is happening to your time.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Find a good place to study. Look around the house 
      for a good study area. Keep this space , which may be a desk or simply a 
      corner of your room, free of everything but study materials. No games, 
      radios, or television! If you can't find such a place at home, find a 
      library where you can study. When you sit down to work, concentrate on the 
      subject! And don't go to the place you have chosen unless you are ready to 
      study.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Scan before you read. This means looking a passage 
      over quickly but thoroughly before you begin to read it more carefully.<br>
      Scanning a passage lets you preview the material and get a general idea of 
      the content. This will actually allow you to skip less important material 
      when you begin to read. Scanning will help you double your reading speed 
      and improve your comprehension.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Make good use of your time in class. Take advantage 
      of class time to listen to everything the teacher says. Sit where you can 
      see and hear well. Really listening in class means less work later. Taking 
      notes will help you remember what the teacher says. When the teacher gets 
      off the subject, stop taking notes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Study regularly. When you get home from class, go 
      over your notes. Review the important points that your teacher mentioned 
      in class. Read any related material in your textbook. If you know what 
      your teacher is going to discuss the next day, scan and read that 
      material, too. This will help you understand the next class. If you do 
      these things regularly, the material will become more meaningful, and you 
      will remember it longer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Develop a good attitude about tests. The purpose of 
      a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. The world won't 
      end if you don't pass a test, so don't get overly worried. Tests do more 
      than just provide grades; they let you know what you need to study more , 
      and they help make your new knowledge permanent.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other techniques that might help you with 
      your studying. Only a handful have been mentioned here. You will probably 
      discover many others after you have tried these.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some kind of planning is essential. For one thing it 
      reveals whether you really have enough to say on the topic you have chosen 
      while there is still time to change to another topic. It is also important 
      because it stimulates your ideas and helps to fix them in your mind 
      Without some notes to help you, you may find that you begin writing with 
      several ideas in your head but you forget some of them as you are writing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have chosen your topic, and perhaps have a 
      general idea of your theme, make quick short notes of all the ideas that 
      come into your head.Remember that these should be notes-words or 
      phrases-not sentences , which would slow you down. As you do this you will 
      find that new ideas will come to you, for one idea leads to another. This 
      should not take more than ten minutes, for in an examination you have no 
      time to waste.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have not yet decided on your main theme , you 
      can do so now, and then on the main idea of each paragraph. You may have 
      to rearrange your ideas, to decide which paragraphs they will fit into, 
      and which ideas will be left out altogether.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for you to decide how detailed your plan should 
      be. If you are good at writing, and have had plenty of practice, probably 
      only a few brief notes will be necessary, but if you are not, then you may 
      require a more detailed plan. But remember that everi the best writers 
      need to make some notes if they are going to produce a well-organized 
      piece of writing. You will of course be given marks for the arrangement of 
      your ideas.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your plan in front of you, you should be able to 
      write your composition. There should be no need to write a rough verseon 
      first, then correct it and make a final copy. This is a waste of time.<br>
      <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Informstion</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There is a lot of misunderstanding about studying. Most students have not 
      been taught the principles behind really effective working. Above is a 
      graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of honrs he 
      works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If 
      he does an hour's work he learns a cerain amount (point 1 ).&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">If he does two 
      hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work 
      he'll learn still more (point 3). Now, it he tried to do 23 1/2 hours' 
      work in 24, he'll be so exhausted that he'll hardly remember anything: 
      what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd 
      learn more (point 5).</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now whatever the exact shape of this curve, it must 
      have a crest. Point X is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And 
      this represents the optimum, the best, amount of work to do. It is the 
      best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue. 
      Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or try to ignore 
      it. If you try to, if you press yourself to'work past the optimum (and any 
      fool can prop his eyelids up and do 14 hours a day ) , you can only get on 
      this downward slope and achieve less than the best-and then get exhausted 
      and lose your power of concentration.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The skill in being a student consists in getting one's 
      daily study as near the optimum point as possible. I cannot tell you what 
      the optimum is. It differs with the type of work, it differs from person 
      to person, andeven in the same person it varies from week to week. You 
      must try to find your own. Every day you study, bear this principle of the 
      optimum in mind. When you feel yourself getting fatigued, if you find 
      yourself repeatedly reading over the same paragraph and not taking it iri, 
      that's a pretty good sign you've reached the crest for the day and should 
      stop.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most ordinary students find their optimum at about five 
      hours a day. Yours may be a little more or a little less-but if you get in 
      five hours' good work a day, you will be doing well.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now. what are you doing with yourself when you aren't 
      working? Before examinations some students do nothing at all except sit in 
      a chair and worry. Here is another misunderstanding. Peop~e too easily 
      think of the mind as if it worked like the body, it does not. If one 
      wanted to conserve physical energy to cut the maximum amount of firewood, 
      one would lie flat on a bed and rest when one wasn't chopping. But the 
      mind cannot rest. Even in sleep you dream, even if you forget your dreams. 
      The mind is always turning. It gets its relaxation only by variety. That 
      is what makes mental rest.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you've finished your optimum hourage you must 
      stop. You must not then sit around in the chair thinking about the 
      work-that only tires without any learning. You must get out and do 
      something. It doesn't matter what-anything so long as you are actively 
      doing something else but work.<br>
