      Text A<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer got off the bus from the university and began 
      walking towards the flat she shared with two other students. On her way 
      she had to buy some food and stopped in one of the shops in the street. It 
      was run by an Asian family, and although the prices there were a little 
      higher than in the big supermarket further down the street, she did a lot 
      of her shopping there. The vegetables were fresher and they had various 
      things she couldn't get elsewhere. Mr Patel, the owner of the shop, was 
      checking through a list, but smiled, as he always did, when he saw her 
      come in.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She picked up a wire basket and walked towards the back 
      of the shop, where the rice was kept: The shop was divided by three long 
      aisles, with rows of shelves crammed with all sorts of things. Except for 
      her and Mr Patel , there were only two other people there. They were two 
      teenage boys, and they were standing at the end of one of the 
      aisles.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">She glanced at 
      them as she passed. They were both wearing long, old-fashioned overcoats 
      and they looked rather ridiculous in them because the coats were too big. 
      But such things were popular with some teenagers at the time. 'Watch out, 
      stupid,' she heard one of them whisper to the other. She walked on to the 
      next aisle and found the rice she was looking for.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Then she 
      heard something else. It sounded like a tin dropping on the floor. She 
      peered through a gap in the shelf and caught a glimpse of one. of the boys 
      bending down. She saw him pick up a tin of food. But instead of putting it 
      in the shopping basket, he dropped it into the inside pocket of his long 
      overcoat. Jennifer glanced back down the aisle. She could see Mr Patel at 
      the cash till, still checking through his list.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Then she 
      looked through the gap in the shelf again. The boys still had their backs 
      to her. 'Come on, let's get out of here,' she heard one of them say. At 
      the same time, she saw one of them put another tin in his overcoat pocket. 
      They moved away from her. She could no longer see what they were doing or 
      hear what they were saymg.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she got to the till, the two boys were in front of 
      her. She watched them pay for the few things they had in the basket. They 
      had both buttoned their coats and fastened them with their belts. Mr Patel 
      did not seem suspicious at all. He even smiled at them as they were about 
      to leave. Jennifer opened her mouth to say something.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only crime I have ever been connected with was 
      unsuccessful. One summer night I went to bed, leaving my bedroom door open 
      because it was very hot. During the night I was woken up by the sound of a 
      match being struck. For a moment I thought it must be the friend I lived 
      with, but then I remembered he was away.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">I felt certain 
      there was someone in the room. I saw the outline of a man standing near 
      the door. I was almost certain the man was a burglar. Without thinking 
      what I was doing, I shouted loudly and. jumped out of bed to catch the 
      man. As I ran across the garden, I suddenly realized I was doing something 
      very foolish. The burglar I was chasing might be carrying a knife. I went 
      straight back into the house and locked all the doors to protect myself.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a very small crime which did not succeed, but 
      crime is a serious problem in Britain. One sort of crime which 
      particularly worries people is juvenile delinquency-that is, crimes 
      committed by young people. For some years, juvenile delinquency has been 
      increasing. There are two main sorts of juvenile crime : stealing and 
      violence. Most people do not understand why young people commit these 
      crimes. There are , I think, a large number of different reasons.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These crimes are not usually committed by people who 
      are poor or in needl. Young people often dislike and resent the adult 
      world. They will do things to show that they are rebels. Also in Britain 
      today it is easier far young people to commit crimes because they have 
      more freedom to go where they like and more money to do what they like.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two other possible causes which are worth 
      mentioning. More and more people in Britain live in large towns. In a 
      large town no one knows who anyone else is or where they live. But in the 
      village I come from crimes are rare because everybody knows everyone else.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is diffcult to explain, I think the last 
      cause is very important. Perhaps there is something wrong with our society 
      which encourages violence and crime. It is a fact that all the time 
      children are exposed to films and reports about crime and violence. Many 
      people do nat agree that this influences young people, but I think that 
      young people are very much influenced<br>
      by the society they grow up in. I feel that the fault may be as tnuch with 
      our whole society as with these young people.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just before school starts, when they check the 
      pupils for guns. By now, the 1,600 students at Chester High School in 
      Philadelphia have got used to it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One by one, they go through a metal detector gate, like 
      the ones at an airport, at the main entrance to their school. The beeper 
      alarm is constantly going off, indicating some metal object in the pupil's 
      pockets. Mostly, it is a key, or coins.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such searches-in some schools a regular routine , in 
      others , a spotcheck- are part of the attempt of school authorities in the 
      United States to keep students from bringing into the classroom their 
      knives, revolvers and machine-guns.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metal detector checks have already become 
      commonplace in schools in Philadelphia, Detroit, and New York. A school in 
      Fairfax, on the outskirts of Washington, D. C. , will soon begin them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School administrators decided that something finally 
      had to be done after the various shootouts and discoveries of weapons in 
      schools around the country had made headlines for weeks running.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 26, at Woodrow Wilson School in Washington, 
      a teenager shot and wounded four others in a fight over a place to sit in 
      the school cafeteria.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 9, teachers confiscated a semi-automatic 
      pistol from two 13-year-olds at a school in the Washington suburb of 
      Silver Spring after they had threatened other students with the weapon. 
      Six days later, a student at Kramer High School in Washington threatened a 
      schoolmate with a sawedoff shotgun. Asked why he did it, the youngster 
      said the other had &quot;stared so stupidly&quot; at him.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list of such incidents goes on and,on, and in some 
      cases, they are fatall.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the California-based &quot; National 
      School Safety Centre &quot; (NSSC) in a recent report, there were 360,000 
      violent incidents in American schools in 1986, the last year for which 
      statistics are available. The incidents ranged from fistfights to 
      shootouts, and 70,000 weapons were confiscated, including 1 , 700 pistols 
      and rifles.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then , says Ronald Stephens , the director of 
      NSSC , the number of incidents involving guns in schools has risen 
      considerably.Teachers and security experts have a hard time explaining why 
      teenagers want to bring lethal weapons with them to school.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Some want to impress their schoolmates,&quot; 
      believes Stephens.&quot;They feel that a gun is a symbol of power and 
      control.Others have a feeling that they need weapons to protectthemselves.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School authorities see the rise in weapons and violence 
      above all as being connected to drugs in American high schools. Armed 
      youth gangs divide up the drug trade turf among themselves. According to 
      the NSSC , the older gang members use the younger newcomers as 
      &quot;weapons depots&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyn Siper of the National Crime Prevention Council in 
      Washington believes that youths during their puberty lean towards fighting 
      out their conflicts instead of talking about them. Such drugs as cocaine 
      and crack add to their emotional disturbance.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siper and Stephens agree that the general level of 
      violence on the streets of big American cities, and the unimpeded access 
      to guns, play a role. America's citizens possess a total of 120 million 
      firearms. Many of the revolvers and rifles which authorities confiscated 
      in the schools had been legally acquired and registered by the students' 
      parents.<br>
