&nbsp; &nbsp;    Have you ever tried to hold your breath for a long time and then let it out slowly? This is one of the techniques of an ancient Indian discipline known as Yoga. For thousands of years, people have used Yoga to help search for happiness and contentment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Students of Yoga often study for as long as 20 years before becoming masters, or Yogis. They learn many different physical exercises. These exercises are designed to put the students in good physical condition. Then they can concentrate on deep religious thoughts without worrying about physical discomforts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Many Yoga exercises involve putting the body into difficult positions. Some of them are very hard to learn. Have you ever tried to fold your legs over one another? This is one of the basic Yoga positions. It is called the lotus position. Most people find it difficult to stay in that position for even a few minutes. But Yogis train themselves to remain in the lotus position for hours or even days. They are taught to overcome the physical discomforts of holding these positions. Other exercises and rules teach concentration. Yogis feel this is the key to finding inner peace. This kind of concentration is called meditation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Yogis and many other people practice meditation. They claim that it makes them feel relaxed and peaceful. Some people say that it makes them feel better ¡ª just as good exercise does. But other people claim that it is a way of achieving a strong religious feeling. These people say that meditation helps them feel much closer to God.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The word Yoga itself comes from an ancient Sanskrit word meaning "union". What kind of union do you think the word refers to? Why would people want to have this kind of experience?<BR>
