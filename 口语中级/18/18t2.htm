&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> <I>Here is one person who really believes in keeping fit. </I></T>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>Her name is Mrs. Laura Taylor. </I></T>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>She is 45 but looks at least 10 years younger. </I></T>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>Let's listen to her story. </I></T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It all started about two years ago. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In those days things were very different. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was overweight. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I used to smoke a lot ¡ª about 30 cigarettes a day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I never got any exercise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I used to stay at home all day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I never went out into the fresh air, except to do the shopping. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And even then I used to take the car. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One day I looked at myself in the mirror. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "My God," I thought. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I look terrible!" </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I tried to touch my toes. I couldn't do it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I found an old dress. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I couldn't put it on. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was too small. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Or rather, I was too fat! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The next day I tried to jog a little. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first it was terrible. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean I just couldn't run. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Not even a short distance. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And at first people used to laugh at me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Why are you running? Are you in a hurry?" they shouted. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But now I've completely changed the way I live. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've stopped eating meat and I've started eating far more fresh vegetables. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My husband and daughter have started that, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first they didn't like the new food. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But they've changed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> About six months ago I sold my car and bought a bike. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Recently I've started doing yoga exercises. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My husband often goes cycling with me now and my daughter jogs with me in the evening. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They've both lost weight and are much healthier than they used to be, too. </T> <BR>
