&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In 1967, <I>The Observer,</I> one of Britain's leading Sunday newspapers, organized a competition for secondary school-children; </T> 
<T TYPE=SEN> they had to write about "The School that I'd Like". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This meant, of course, that they also had to say what was wrong with the schools they had. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> David, 15 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But what is the main purpose of schools to educate young people so that when they go out into the world they will be prepared for it? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But are they? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We learn our Mathematics, English, Physics, etc. , but what do you learn about sex, marriage and things like this? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> These are just as important but we don't learn very much about them. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Carol, 17 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Give us more variety! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Give us the chance to visit factories more frequently, to talk with miners, dustmen, doctors, lawyers, jail-birds and drug addicts, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Give us the chance to visit remand homes and prisons. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We want to know more about life and less about books. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Robin, 16 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What a bore school is nowadays, the same as it has been for hundreds of years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What we get is the same old thing: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> teacher, outdated textbooks, and a class fed up to the teeth with the teacher and the school. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What we need is one great change in the educational system of the country. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Children do not want to be taught at, but want to find things for themselves. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If a child is interested in the way a rabbit's heart works, let him go and find out, by cutting one up. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Irena, 15 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Homework should not be given. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many of us would rather spend another hour at school than two hours at home doing an hour's homework, where we are constantly being distracted by television and such things. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sidney, 15 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The first step must surely be to raise teachers' salaries by at least fifty per cent so as to attract first-class people to the profession. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And the only means of doing this is by offering salaries equal to their responsibility in shaping the hopes of tomorrow and competitive with those offered by industry. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Christopher, 16 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The discipline and life of the school would be based on freedom for the pupil. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So freedom and a minimum of control would be important and the pupils, male and female, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> would be treated as adults and allowed to see if they can live together in a community like intelligent people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Given this responsibility and freedom, the pupils obviously would not always be well-behaved and sensible, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but they would, I believe, grow up to be mature and intelligent adults who are socially and in all other ways, useful to the community. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Margaret, 14 </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> ... all this (i. e. freedom in schools) suggests that the school would always be chaotic, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> which would give all the pupils an insight into what life, after school, is like: chaos. </T> <BR>
