&nbsp; &nbsp;    It was nothing for a girl to be sent away to service when she was eleven years old. That meant leaving the family as she had never been parted from for a day in her life before, and going to some place miles away to be treated like a dog. I've got nothing against girls going into good service. In my opinion, good service in a properly run big house was a wonderful training for a lot of girls who never would have seen anything different all the days of their lives if they hadn't gone. It was better than working on the land, then, and if it still existed now, I reckon I'd rather see any of my daughters be a good housemaid or a well-trained parlour maid than a dolled-up shop assistant or a factory worker. But folks are too proud to work for other folks, now, even if it's to their own advantage, though as far as I can see you are still working for other folks, whatever you're doing. Big houses didn't want little girls of eleven, even as kitchen maids, so the first few years had to be put in somewhere else, before you got even that amount of promotion. Big houses expected good service, but you got good treatment in return. It wasn't like that at the sort of place my friends had to go. Mostly they went to the farmers' houses within ten or twenty miles from where they'd been born. These farmers were a jumped up, proud lot who didn't know how to treat the people who worked for them. They took advantage of the poor people's need to get their girls off their hands to get little slaves for nearly nothing. The conditions were terrible.<BR>
