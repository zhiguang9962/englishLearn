&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Maria had decided that as soon as she had finished school she would become an au pair girl in London. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Two of her friends had already spent a year with a family in Kensington, and told her they had had an interesting time and had managed to learn a lot of English. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was advised by her Head Teacher to get her parents' consent and to make all the necessary arrangements prior to her departure: </T> 
<T TYPE=SEN> have enough money for her return fare, know exactly what kind of a family she was going to live with and what they expected of her. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Shortly after her eighteenth birthday Maria received a letter from Mrs. Hutchinson, the wife of an advertising executive, stating the terms on which she would be employed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Hutchinsons lived in a house in Chelsea. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had three children: two boys, aged fourteen and ten, both at boarding schools, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the elder at a Public School in the Midlands and the younger at a Preparatory School in Surrey; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the youngest child was a girl aged eight, and she went to the French Lycee in South Kensington. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> During term time Maria would have to take the girl to school in the morning and fetch her in the afternoon. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She would have to help Mrs. Hutchinson in the house ¡ª </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> washing up, making the beds, laying the table, dusting the rooms, answering the door, taking telephone messages, shopping and running errands. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She would be guaranteed three evenings a week free and could attend English classes either from eleven till one in the morning or from half past one till four in the afternoon. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She would receive ¡ê3 a week pocket money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Maria was delighted with the conditions and thought that they were fair. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She also liked the look of the family, as Mrs. Hutchinson had thoughtfully enclosed a photograph with her letter. </T> <BR>
