<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Brooks, Martin, Robert and Jean are being interviewed on the subject of friendship. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. BROOKS: I consider friendship to be one of the most important things in life ！ whatever your status, married or single. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I see too many lonely people around. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A lot of us get so involved with material values, family problems, "keeping up with the Joneses," etc., that we forget the real meaning of friendship. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: Which is what, according to you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. BROOKS: They say "a friend in need is a friend indeed" which is partly true, but a real friend should also be able to share your happy moments ！ without feeling jealous. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A good friendship is one where you accept and forgive faults, understand moods, and don't feel hurt if a friend doesn't feel like seeing you. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course, honesty is an essential part of any relationship. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We should learn to accept our friends for what they are. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: As a married man, do you find your friendships are only with other men? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. BROOKS: Of course not! Both my wife and I have men and women friends ！ thank goodness. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Although family life is fulfilling, it isn't enough! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Both my wife and I get tremendous satisfaction from our friends, married and single, male and female ！ and we both have our separate friends too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We'd get bored with each other if we had the same friends! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: You must have a full life. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. BROOKS: We certainly do! And as I say, our friends give us a lot of pleasure. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After all, friends should not be people with whom you kill time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Real friendship, in my opinion, is a "spiritually developing" experience. </T> <BR>
(Martin, Robert and Jean are being interviewed on the subject of friendship.)  <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: How important are friends to you, Martin? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARTIN: I've never had a lot of friends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've never regarded them as particularly important. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps that's because I come from a big family. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Two brothers and three sisters. And lots of cousins. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And that's what's really important to me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My family. The different members of my family. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you really need help, you get it from your family, don't you? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Well, at least that's what I've always found. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: What about you, Jean? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: To me friendship ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> having friends, people I know I can really count on ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> to me that's the most important thing in life. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's more important even than love. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you love someone, you can always fall out of love again, and that can lead to a lot of hurt feelings, bitterness, and so on. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But a good friend is a friend for life. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: And what exactly do you mean by a friend? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: Well, I've already said, someone you know you can count on. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suppose what I really mean is ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> let's see, how am I going to put this ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> it's someone who will help you if you need help, who'll listen to you when you talk about your problems ... someone you can trust. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: What do you mean by a friend, Robert? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ROBERT: Someone who likes the same things that you do, who you can argue with and not lose your temper, even if you don't always agree about things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean someone who you don't have to talk to all the time but can be silent with perhaps. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's important, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You can just sit together and not say very much sometimes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just relax. I don't like people who talk all the time. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> INTERVIEWER: Are you very good at keeping in touch with your friends if you don't see them regularly? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ROBERT: No, not always. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've lived in lots of places, and, to be honest, once I move away I often do drift out of touch with my friends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I'm not a very good letter writer, either. Never have been. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I know that if I saw those friends again, if I ever moved back to the same place, or for some other reason we got back into close contact again, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm sure the friendship would be just as strong as it was before. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: Several of my friends have moved away, got married, things like that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of my friends has had a baby recently, and I'll admit I don't see her or hear from her as much as I used to ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She lives in another neighbourhood and when I phone her, she always seems busy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But that's an exception. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I write a lot of letters to my friends and get a lot of letters from them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have a friend I went to school with and ten years ago she emigrated to Canada, but she still writes to me every month, and I write to her just as often. </T> <BR>
