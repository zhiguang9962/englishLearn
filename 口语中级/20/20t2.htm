<T TYPE=SEN> <P align=center><B>A Friend in Need of Help </B></P></T> <BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> You and Sol have been friends for over fifteen years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You went to high school together and now work in the same company. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For the past several months, Sol has been very irritable and at times has shown his emotions by openly criticizing the company and some of his fellow workers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Most of the people in the office know that he sometimes drinks too much when he feels depressed about some of his personal and family problems. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But recently Sol made a very nasty personal comment which hurt one of the people in the office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No one said anything to him, but it was obvious that many people were angry at what he said and now have little sympathy for him. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> You are beginning to wonder whether you should say something to Sol. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You don't consider him your best friend, but he might possibly lose his job because you didn't try to help him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On the other hand, you don't know whether Sol would think that you were interfering in his private life by talking about his personal problems. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What would you do in this situation? </T> <BR>
