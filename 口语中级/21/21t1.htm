&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I wonder why so many shop-assistants are so foul-tempered?  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In spite of so many "campaigns" to improve the services in the past years, we see no appreciable change so far. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If Dad and Mum are to be believed, the services used to be quite good in the fifties. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But then, they always say everything used to be good in the fifties. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I find the older people grow, the more nostalgic they become. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now Granny never lets a day go by without reminiscing on the good old things in the good old days. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Once when she saw Xiao Hong and me eating some mooncakes with relish, she said pityingly, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You poor children, you don't know what real mooncakes taste like. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The worst in the old days tasted much better than the best that money can buy nowadays!" </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We burst out laughing, not taking her words seriously. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Now to come back to the bad service in shops and department stores. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People often say that when you buy something, you are spending money to buy rudeness and anger. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Today I saw a man doing exactly that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was at a department store and I happened to witness a typical quarrel. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was next to a counter selling tea and I saw an elderly man come up and ask a young woman who was busy weighing and wrapping tea into standard-sized packs. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Do you have very good green tea?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The woman glanced up to size him up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was ordinarily dressed and spoke with a provincial accent, obviously a man of no consequence. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She went on with her work and the man had to repeat his question. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After another pause the woman snorted out:  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Yes. Twenty-six <I>yuan</I> a <I>liang."</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Not believing his ears, the man tried to correct her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You mean twenty-six <I>yuan</I> a <I>jin?"</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Upon this the woman flared up and shouted: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I said twenty-six <I>yuan</I> a <I>LIANG!</I> Can't you hear straight? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you want a jin, then it's two hundred and sixty <I>yuan.</I> Is that <I>CLEAR?"</I></T>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The man seemed to be stunned by her sudden outburst, but he kept his temper and asked again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Do you have something under two <I>yuan</I> a <I>Liang?"</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Obviously she was making things difficult for the old man for she answered as rudely as before: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "What do you mean under two <I>yuan?</I> Anything from one cent to one <I>yuan</I> ninety-nine cents is under two <I>yuan."</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't remember what exactly the man said, but somehow he managed to find out there was a kind costing one <I>yuan</I> ninety-six a <I>liang.</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Can you show it to me?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Do you want to buy it or not?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, I want to look at the leaves and smell the flavour first." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You can look, smell, eat, drink or do whatever you like with it at home. Here I only sell tea.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you want to buy it, buy it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you can't afford it, don't come here to waste people's time! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Obviously you don't know what is proper in Beijing!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Look here young lady, it's you who don't know what is proper! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have been living in Beijing long before you were born, and I've never seen anyone as rude as you are. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Your job is to serve the customers, not to insult them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now for the last time, are you going to show me the tea or not?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "And for the last time I am telling it to you. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Either buy it or get out of here! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I know the likes of you ¡ª you want something good, and yet grudge the money you have to spend on it!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "This is insufferable£¡ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who is in charge here? I want to see your head!"  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "My head? It's on my shoulders. Take a good look if you want to."</T>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The old man went away fuming. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I've got down your number. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'll write to the Evening News." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The threat didn't seem to frighten the girl. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At most she'll have to make a self-criticism, which costs her nothing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even if she should lose a month's bonus, it is only a few <I>yuan.</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But if she could be sacked, I bet she wouldn't dare to be so rude and aggressive. </T> <BR>
