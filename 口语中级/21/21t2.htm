&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> All the housewives who went to the new supermarket had one great ambition: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> to be the lucky customer who did not have to pay for her shopping. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For this was what the notice just inside the entrance promised. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It said: "Remember, once a week, one of our customers gets free goods. This may be your lucky day!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For several weeks Mrs. Edwards hoped, like many of her friends, to be the lucky customer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Unlike her friends, she never gave up hope. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The cupboards in her kitchen were full of things which she did not need. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In vain her husband tried to dissuade her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She dreamed of the day when the manager of the supermarket would approach her and say: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Madam, this is your lucky day. Everything in your basket is free." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One Friday morning, after she had finished her shopping and had taken it to her car, she found that she had forgotten to buy any tea. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She dashed back to the supermarket, got the tea and went towards the cashdesk. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As she did so, she saw the manager of the supermarket approach her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Madam," he said, holding out his hand, "I want to congratulate you! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You are our lucky customer and everything you have in your basket is free!" </T> <BR>
