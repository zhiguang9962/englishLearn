      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hobby can be almost anything a person likes to do in 
      his spare time. Hobbyists raise pets, build model ships, weave baskets, or 
      carve soap figures.They watch birds, hunt animals, climb mountains, raise 
      flowers, fish, ski, skate, and swim. Hobbyists also paint pictures, attend 
      concerts and plays, and perform on musical instruments. They collect 
      everything from books to butterflies, and from shells to stamps.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People take up hobbies because these activities offer 
      enjoyment, friendship, knowledge, and relaxation. Sometimes they even 
      yield financial profit. Hobbies help people relax after periods of hard 
      work, and provide a balance between work and play. Hobbies also offer 
      interesting activities for persons who have retired. Anyone, rich or poor, 
      old or young, sick or well, can follow a satisfying hobby, regardless of 
      his age, position, or income.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hobbies can help a person's mental and physical health. 
      Doctors have found that hobbies are valuable in helping patients recover 
      from physical or mental illness. Hobbies give bedridden or wheel-chair 
      patients something to do, and provide interests that keep them from 
      thinking about themselves. Many hospitals treat patients by having them 
      take up interesting hobbies or pastimes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early times, most people were too busy making a 
      living to have many hobbies. But some persons who had leisure did enjoy 
      hobbies. The ancient Egyptians played games with balls made of wood, 
      pottery, and papyrus. some Greeks and Romans collected miniature soldiers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People today have more time than ever before for 
      hobbies. Machines and automation have reduced the amount of time they must 
      spend on their jobs. Hobbies provide variety for workers who do the same 
      monotonous tasks all day long. More people are retiring than ever before, 
      and at an earlier age. Those who have developed hobbies never need to 
      worry about what to do with their newly-found leisure hours.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir William Osler, a famous Canadian doctor, expressed 
      the value of hobbies by saying, &quot;No man is really happy or safe 
      without a hobb.y, and it makes precious little difference what the outsidc 
      interest may be-botany, bcetles, or butterflies; roses, tulips, or irises: 
      fishing, mountaimeering, or antiques - anything will do so long as he 
      straddles a hobby and rides it hard. &quot;<br>
