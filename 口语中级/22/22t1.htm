<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: What I like most, I suppose, is the fact that it's so unusual. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean, when I tell people what I do, they just look at me usually as if I'm mad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Maybe I am, anyway what I do is this. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I get up about a quarter past six every morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I leave my wife in bed because she's not as mad as me ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and I put my trunks on under my tracksuit and drive down to the park with my clothes in a case. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It only takes about five minutes because there's no traffic of course at that time in the morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So, when I get there I leave the car in the car park and run round a bit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I usually run for about ten minutes till I'm nice and warm, then comes the interesting bit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I run over to the car, get my case and then over to the pool. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I take my tracksuit off and ！ in I jump. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's pretty cold I can tell you especially in the middle of winter ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but I do a couple of quick lengths and then I climb out, get changed and drive home, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I just get back in time for breakfast ！ and I normally feel I've earned it too. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: Well, it's very detailed work you see, but I find it very relaxing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's strange I suppose that something like this where you have to concentrate a lot can be relaxing, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but you see in my job I'm always making decisions and telling people what to do but I never actually see what I've done. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is completely different. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You see, here I'm actually making something myself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I start with a kite, usually it's got all the basic materials in it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then you have to cut out all the shapes from the wood and stick them together. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you've made the frame, the wings and the fuselage, that is, you cover them with special paper and paint. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course if it's going to fly properly, everything has to be properly balanced, you know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I must say really though. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think I enjoy actually making them more than flying them. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: Well in a sense I suppose I do it to save money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean things are so incredibly expensive in the shops nowadays, aren't they? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But that's not the only reason really. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No, the beautiful thing is that you can make what you want when you want ！ and in material you've chosen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean you don't have to depend on some Paris designer to say what is fashionable. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you like an idea you see then of course you can copy it, but it gives you much more independence to do it yourself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean obviously it takes time, but I enjoy it, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and with a sewing machine it doesn't take all that long to make even quite complicated things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And then finally you know that you've got something really unique. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Especially if it's something you've designed yourself. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HARRY: Well, it gives me the chance to be alone ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and for me that's really the most important thing I suppose, after being with crowds of people all week. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It gives you time to think, you know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And another thing is that it gets me out of doors. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suppose it isn't very energetic really after all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean you don't do very much except just sit there, but at least it's in the fresh air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And that's more than you can say for things like darts, isn't it? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No, that's really what I like about it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I like having time to think in the open air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm not terribly keen on the man against animal bit, you know man the hunter against nature. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No, actually I don't usually catch very many you know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And if I do, I always throw them straight back. </T> <BR>
