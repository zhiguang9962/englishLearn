&nbsp; &nbsp;    Wang is a school teacher in Shimen in east Sichuan. At 36 he was still a lonely bachelor and was likely to remain one until one day towards the end of 1988 he happened to read in the matrimonial column of a magazine an advertisement which read: Yang, a woman of 31 who is a family planning officer in a certain township in south Sichuan, seeks a reliable and understanding man for a spouse having been disappointed in her first love affair by the man she has lost her heart to ..."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Somehow this advertisement appealed to Wang greatly. After much thought he plucked up his courage and wrote to this woman Yang. It was the first love letter he had written in his life. To his surprise and great joy he got a very warm response. Things went so smoothly in fact that very soon the woman appeared before him in flesh and blood, with a divorce certificate in her hand to prove that she was a free woman and was sincere in her desire to marry him. Wang could hardly believe in his own luck, and so with great haste he said good-bye to his bachelor life. On the wedding night, however, he got a great shock when he discovered that his bride was already three months pregnant. But he was a reasonable man, and instead of blaming her he did his best to console her, assuring her that nothing could alter his love for her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    And he was as good as his words, so the newly-wed couple lived in harmony and bliss until half a year later when Yang gave birth to a lovely plump son. Wang cared for the mother and child as if he was the real father. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Then on the day of the full month of the baby, Wang came home from school to find that his wife had prepared a small feast. Overjoyed and touched by this show of affection, he nevertheless admonished her for overtiring herself while secretly congratulating himself for having found such a considerate and loving wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Then, before he had finished eating and with the wine still warm in his heart, Yang suddenly said to him: "Happily we got together, now let us gladly part!" Wang could hardly believe his ears. "Please don't talk such nonsense!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    "I'm not talking nonsense. We have to divorce. To be quite honest, I don't find it easy leaving you like this, and I feel very sad having cheated you. You are a very good man. But I was a happily married woman with a lovely daughter. Our only regret was having no son. What were we to do? I couldn't very well give a second birth, especially as I am a family planning officer. So my husband and I worked out this plan... We agreed to divorce temporarily after having made sure I was pregnant again. I had secretly gone to see a doctor and he had given me hope that it was likely going to be a boy, and so we went ahead with our plan. After I put out the advertisement, I got many offers. We picked on you for two reasons. First, you are a teacher and therefore are likely to be a reasonable man and would not make things difficult for me. Secondly, you are no longer so young and would not be too choosy and therefore would readily take me ... Now you know all. Say whatever you like. Curse me, call me names ... All I ask is that you forgive me and let me go back to my former husband."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Wang was dumb-founded. In vain he tried to plead and remonstrate, and begged her to stay. But Yang was adamant. "I still love my former husband. Our divorce was not for real in the first place. If you don't let me go, you can only keep my body, but you can't keep my heart. I had made it clear in my advertisement that I had lost my heart to my first love!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    In the end the good, honest Wang had to agree to divorce her and let her go. Left alone again, Wang thought not only of the injury done to himself, but the deceit and trickery on the part of the couple to dodge the law, and the woman was supposed to be some sort of officer of the law too. Could such a monstrous thing be allowed? Was the force of feudal ideas so much stronger than the force of law?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    We may well ask the same questions.<BR>
