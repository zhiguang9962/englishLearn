      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder whether smoking is as harmful as doctors make 
      us believe it to be? Some of the things they say are really hair-raising, 
      and even if only half of what they say is true , then it is , if not 
      suicidal, at least a self-inflicted chronic disease.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This afternoon our League branch organized a discussion 
      on the harmful effects of smoking and what effective measures should be 
      taken to prevent young people from smoking. According to our form master , 
      50 % of our class smoke , or have smoked at one time or another. If that 
      is true, then all the boys because we make up about 50 % of our class- I 
      can hardly believe that.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      I, for one, certainly don't smoke, though I must admit I did once take a 
      few puffs just out of curiositys , but you can't call that smoking.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discussion was quite a lively one. The girls , of 
      course , all spoke in one voice against smoking , but for the most part , 
      they had nothing original to offer besides repeating what we can read in 
      the papers and popular science magazines. At first the boys listened in 
      glum silence and I could see boredom and disdain on their faces. Then the 
      cross-fire between Fatty and Liu Dandan livened the meeting up.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Dandan has always 
      been something of an actress and in her theatrical manner she went on and 
      on describing how bad a cigarette tastes. Fatty couldn't contain himself 
      any longer and muttered under his breath, &quot;Heavens , you must be a 
      very experienced smoker! &quot; Everybody burst out laughing and Dandan 
      spluttered with rage. The girls rallied round her and began to attack 
      Fatty. Of course we could have none of that and the classroom was soon in 
      uproar.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;All right you boys and girls , that is quite 
      enough. Show some sense. &quot; Our form master's firm voice had quite a 
      sobering effect and order was restored again. &quot;Those who do smoke, 
      please put up your hands. &quot; Taken by surprise, nobody made any move. 
      &quot;Come on. There is nothing to fear. This is not for punishment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      I only want statistics. I only want information so that we can really find 
      out something about smoking. &quot; We looked at each other. First Fatty, 
      then about half a dozen boys raised their hands. Then our form master 
      proceeded to ask each of them why they smoked and whether they liked 
      smoking. Did they ever try to give it up? Why not? And so on and so on. 
      Soon he didn't have to ask any questions as we all volunteered information 
      and the discussion became very lively and the atmosphere relaxed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some interesting facts came out. Family and 
      surroundings play a very important part in influencing smokers. All those 
      who smoke come from smoking families or are surrounded by smoking friends 
      and relatives. Films and TV plays also play a part. In the past only 
      villains smoked and drank. Now heroes also smoke and drink, and heroes now 
      are mostly young people with the &quot;spirit of the 80s&quot; fighting 
      feudalism and conservatism.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">As to those who 
      smoked and have given up , they did so because they didn't enjoy smoking 
      and found it too expensive. Very few people think about health dangers. 
      All those who still smoke admit that they don't derive any great pleasure 
      out of smoking. Srncking haa not bccome a a.a:rdenecl habit with them and 
      they could give it up easily if thcy really wanted to. They just haven't 
      felt any urgent need to do it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very interesting and rewarding discussion . Those 
      smokers who haven't given much thought to their smoking will, I'm sure, 
      give more thought to it now.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people like changing their habits , good or bad , 
      and , whether it is smoking, drinking or over-eating, they continue 
      `enjoying' them to the end, often the bitter end. On every packet of 
      cigarettes and in every advertisement , Americans are warned against the 
      dangers of smoking, &quot;Warning ; The Surgeon Gcneral Has Determined 
      That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">In spite of this, 
      millions of them start smoking or go on smoking. Why ? One reason rnay be 
      that people watch their 'heroes' on TV drinking alcohol, smoking 
      cigarettes and fighting their way from adventure to adventure, `heroes' 
      who seem to fear nothing, neither killing other people nor killing 
      themselves with alcohol and cigarettes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;If they are 
      not afraid of the effects of smoking and drinking alcohol, why should John 
      Smith , sitting at home in his armchair watching all this, be afraid? The 
      simple warning on the cigarette packet does not influence his 
      &quot;hero's&quot; habits either. But even stronger warnings, likc showing 
      pictures of smokers who have lost a leg or died of canccr, seem to have no 
      effect on people's smoking habits. Knowing and believing seem to be two 
      different things.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The young 
      girl smoking a cigarette in the advertisement runs the risk of dying of 
      cancer in a few years. The smoker sitting next to you may have a heart 
      attack next week. But don't worry ! The chance of dying in an accident is 
      just as great. Particularly if enough people agree with one advertiser 
      that driving a car at 212 m. p. h. and smoking interesting cigarettes is 
      all that life is really<br>
      about.<br>

      World 'No Tohacco' Day<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People in all parts of the world are observing &quot;No 
      Tobacco Day&quot;. It is the day when the World Health Organization 
      appeals to people to stop using tobacco products. The W-H-O hopes if 
      people stop smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco for one day, they will 
      stop permanently.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day includes special observances and awards 
      ceremonies in onehundred-sixty-six countries. The target group for this 
      year's &quot;No Tobacco Day&quot; is women. Organizers want to make sure 
      women know the dangers of smoking.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health experts have warned for years that smoking can 
      lead to heart disease, cancer and other problems. The World Health 
      Organization says diseases linked to smoking kill at least two-million 
      five-hundred-thousand persons each ycar.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, many people find it difficult to stop smoking. 
      One reason is nicotime,<br>
      a substance found in cigarettes. Nicotine is a drug. 'The effects of 
      nicotine are similar to the effects of cocaine and heroin.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No Tobacco Day&quot; is aimed at smokers and 
      those who earn money from tobacco sales. So businesses are asked to stop 
      selling tobacco products for twenty-four hours. Newspapers are asked not 
      to publish advertisements for cigarettes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two important developments have been observed in recent 
      years. In inciustrial count.ries, the number of smokers has been falling 
      about one percerit a vear. But in developing countries, the number has 
      bcen rising two percent a year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the result of increased efforts by tobacco 
      companies to sell their products in developing countrics.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The World Health Organization has approved plans to 
      help reach its goal of a 'smoke-free' world. One urges governments to 
      offer tobacco farmers the chance to earn money by growing other crops. 
      Another involves improved public information campaigns about the dangers 
      of smoking.<br>
