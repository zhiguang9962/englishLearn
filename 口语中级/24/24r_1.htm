<P align=center><B>World "No Tobacco" Day</B></P><BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    People in all parts of the world are observing "No Tobacco Day". It is the day when the World Health Organization appeals to people to stop using tobacco products. The W-H-O hopes if people stop smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco for one day, they will stop permanently. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The day includes special observances and awards ceremonies in one-hundred-sixty-six countries. The target group for this year's "No Tobacco Day" is women. Organizers want to make sure women know the dangers of smoking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Health experts have warned for years that smoking can lead to heart disease, cancer and other problems. The World Health Organization says diseases linked to smoking kill at least two-million five-hundred-thousand persons each year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Still, many people find it difficult to stop smoking. One reason is nicotine, a substance found in cigarettes. Nicotine is a drug. The effects of nicotine are similar to the effects of cocaine and heroin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    "No Tobacco Day" is aimed at smokers and those who earn money from tobacco sales. So businesses are asked to stop selling tobacco products for twenty-four hours. Newspapers are asked not to publish advertisements for cigarettes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Two important developments have been observed in recent years. In industrial countries, the number of smokers has been falling about one percent a year. But in developing countries, the number has been rising two percent a year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    This is the result of increased efforts by tobacco companies to sell their products in developing countries. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The World Health Organization has approved plans to help reach its goal of a "smoke-free" world. One urges governments to offer tobacco farmers the chance to earn money by growing other crops. Another involves improved public information campaigns about the dangers of smoking.<BR>
