&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I wonder whether smoking is as harmful as doctors make us believe it to be? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some of the things they say are really hair-raising, and even if only half of what they say is true, then it is, if not suicidal, at least a self-inflicted chronic disease. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This afternoon our League branch organized a discussion on the harmful effects of smoking and what effective measures should be taken to prevent young people from smoking. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> According to our form master, 50% of our class smoke, or have smoked at one time or another. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If that is true, then all the boys must be smokers, because we make up about 50% of our class ¡ª I can hardly believe that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I, for one, certainly don't smoke, though I must admit I did once take a few puffs just out of curiosity, but you can't call that smoking. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The discussion was quite a lively one. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The girls, of course, all spoke in one voice against smoking, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but for the most part, they had nothing original to offer besides repeating what we can read in the papers and popular science magazines. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first the boys listened in glum silence and I could see boredom and disdain on their faces. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then the cross-fire between Fatty and Liu Dandan livened the meeting up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Dandan has always been something of an actress and in her theatrical manner she went on and on describing how bad a cigarette tastes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Fatty couldn't contain himself any longer and muttered under his breath, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Heavens, you must be a very experienced smoker!" </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everybody burst out laughing and Dandan spluttered with rage. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The girls rallied round her and began to attack Fatty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course we could have none of that and the classroom was soon in uproar. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "All right you boys and girls, that is quite enough. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Show some sense." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Our form master's firm voice had quite a sobering effect and order was restored again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Those who do smoke, please put up your hands." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Taken by surprise, nobody made any move. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Come on. There is nothing to fear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is not for punishment. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I only want statistics. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I only want information so that we can really find out something about smoking." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We looked at each other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> First Fatty, then about half a dozen boys raised their hands. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then our form master proceeded to ask each of them why they smoked and whether they liked smoking. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Did they ever try to give it up? Why not? And so on and so on. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Soon he didn't have to ask any questions as we all volunteered information and the discussion became very lively and the atmosphere relaxed. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some interesting facts came out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Family and surroundings play a very important part in influencing smokers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All those who smoke come from smoking families or are surrounded by smoking friends and relatives. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Films and TV plays also play a part. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the past only villains smoked and drank. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now heroes also smoke and drink, and heroes now are mostly young people with the "spirit of the 80s" fighting feudalism and conservatism. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As to those who smoked and have given up, they did so because they didn't enjoy smoking and found it too expensive. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Very few people think about health dangers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All those who still smoke admit that they don't derive any great pleasure out of smoking. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Smoking has not become a hardened habit with them and they could give it up easily if they really wanted to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They just haven't felt any urgent need to do it. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A very interesting and rewarding discussion. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Those smokers who haven't given much thought to their smoking will, I'm sure, give more thought to it now. </T> <BR>
