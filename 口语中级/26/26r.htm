&nbsp; &nbsp; It's a hospital scene. People are lining up for registration. After seeing the doctor they come back to line up again for their medicine, Of course it's a very time-consuming process, because they have to get the prescriptions priced at one window and pay at another. Then at the last window they get their medicine. That means altogether they have to line up at three different windows just to get their medicine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To avoid all this trouble, a smart woman works out the most convenient way of getting her medicine. She herself stands at the end of the first line and puts her pram with her baby in it, a toy duck and her own bag at the end of the other three lines. She has them all strung together with the wool yarn with which she's knitting. She believes this will save her the trouble of lining up three times.<BR>
