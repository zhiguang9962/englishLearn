        Is It an Ideal Career?<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Text A<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not an extreme feminist. I am not an extreme 
        anything. However, I am a firm believer in equality and freedom. I think 
        we are all entitled to the same rights and opportunities.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps my views on feminism are influenced by the 
        fact that I was an only child and perhaps if I had had a brother,he (and 
        I) might have been treated differently.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother was the perfect example of all an ardent 
        feminist would hate: she waited hand and foot on my father and did it 
        all without complaint. When my father arrived home from work his soup 
        was served. Every night his clothes for the next day were left out with 
        the underwear thoughtfully placed on top so that he didn't even have to 
        think what to put on first.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">His shoes were 
        always polished for him, his right to be first in the bathroom was never 
        challenged, and if he ever found himself in the kitchen, it was by 
        mistake. My mother was honestly content with this situstion and regarded 
        my father as a perfect husband: he was a caring, generous man-a good 
        provider. What more could any woman ask?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember being brought up, not as a male or 
        femaie,but simply as an individual, and although I suppose I must have 
        been influenced by my parents, I do not remember ever being eneouraged 
        to make marriage my major ambition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to marry a man who did not 
        expect to chain me to the kitchen sink. He was quite capable of 
        polishing his own shoes , and mine too while he was at it. He was also 
        able to wash dishes , dust , or do anything else around the house. We 
        managed beautifully, with no strict male/female division of labour.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first baby arrived, much to our delight, six 
        months ago. I was more than pleased to give up my job as I had become 
        sick of it. I looked forward to my baby, and now he is here I actually 
        enjoy him very much. I have no intention of returning to Work, as I 
        think our son ought to have a parent to care for him for a few years at 
        least. Indeed, I could be very happy with the situation, were I not 
        experiencing quite unexpected problems adapting to my new role.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I attended the ante-natal clinicfi, I remember 
        the doctor asking me what I 'was' , meaning my occupation, rather than 
        my blood group or star sign. Yet when I went to the baby clinic for the 
        first time, all they wanted to know was what my husband 'was'. I am 
        still wonderirig what difference that makes to anything, and I was hurt 
        that nobody wanted to know about me any more. Quite suddenly I was just 
        someone's wife and someone's mother. I no longer seemed to have an 
        identity of my</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, previously, my husband was quite happy to help 
        around the house, his attitude now seems to be that if I'm at home all 
        day, I can do all the housework. And what bugs me most is that I find 
        myself going along with it. If the baby cries during the night, then 
        there is no question about who gets up. Have I taken leave of my senses? 
        My sense of self-esteern seems to be clogged with baby powder and baby 
        cream! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the aspect of motherhood I've found hardest to 
        take has been the loss of earning power, and what I see as a loss of 
        financial independence. For seven years I enjoyed helping to bring home 
        the bacon; and money never caused a row. It does now.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the decision to have our baby and for me to 
        stay at home was a joint one, I feel totally dependent on my husband, 
        who is becoming more and more irritated by my stupidity. The indignity 
        of being financially dependent on my husband is something I feel very, 
        sensitive about. Logically, having a baby ought to have extended me as a 
        person: I should be the person I was plus the person I am, as a result 
        of my new experience.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It hasn't worked out like that. Motherhood seems to 
        have wiped out ten years of varied and interesting work experience and 
        taken me back, not forwards-a whole generation back. But the hig 
        difference between my mother and me is that she was happy and I am not. 
        I know a conflict that she couldn't have imagined.</font></p>

        Text B<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a specia! day in honour of teachers is a fine 
        thing. But one day a year is not enough!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where would the world be withocrt teachers? What hope 
        would there be for human progress? Teachers deserve the respect of the 
        whole of society the whole year round. But they haven't got it. What is 
        most remarkable and regrettable is that in this great land of China, 
        with its ancient civilization and traditional respect for learning, 
        teachers are so looked d'own upon that it is necessary to set aside a 
        day to show respect for them.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this? I believe that teachers' low social 
        status is inseparable<br>
        from their I'ow pay, and poor living and: working conditions-though<br>
        these are gradually being improved. But still the state allocation of 
        funds for education is, per capila, amongthe lowest in the world. So 
        teachers are, in gengeral,under-paid and overworded-especially those in 
        pre-school, primary and secondary education.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">This despite 
        the faat that Comrade Deng Xiaoping immediately onv resuming office 
        pointedout: education is a continuous process and the pay and'conditions 
        of teachers from the most elementary level must be improved. This 
        statement was most encouraging', but progress since it was made, some 
        years ago,. has been painfully slow.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So today, who wants to become a teacher? Who wants to 
        marry a teacher? When far better prospects are offered in other 
        professions?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;True,&quot;man 
        does not live by bread alone &quot; -but he can't live without it. Of 
        course many fine dedicated people are still willing, even eager to 
        become and remain teachers. Many, but not enough. That's one reason why 
        there are middle sehool classes of 70 and more pupils , an intolerabl'e 
        situation. The lower the number of students in a class , the higher the 
        quality of education can be.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I am not speaking personally. Looking back 
        on, 35 years as a teacher in China I feel grateful. As a teacher here I 
        have had a happy and rewarding life. Being surrounded by young people 
        has helped to keep me young. But my pay and conditions are well above 
        those of my Chinese colleagues.A big and rapid improvement in their 
        social status, together with a similar improvement in their pay, working 
        cond'i~ions and bousing, will attract more and more fine people to the 
        teaching profession. Th is a vital and urgent necessity for China's 
        socialist modernization.<br>

        Additional Information<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many of you this will be your last year at shcool 
        and now is the time for you to begin thinking seriously about your 
        future careers. In order to give you as much help as possible, I have 
        drawn up a list of questions that you ought to ask yourself.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &quot;Have I given thought to what I would like to be doing 15 to 20 
        yeas from now?&quot; Bear in mind that the career you choose will affect 
        the future course of your life. It will partially determine your range 
        of friends, your choice of husband or wife, where you live, your 
        recreational activities. and other important aspects of your life.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have I a clear knowledge of my abilities and 
        aptitudes, as well as my interests and aims?&quot; &amp; honest about 
        your weak points as well as your strong ones. Take a really good look at 
        yourself and give real thought to the kind of person you are, what you 
        are good at, and what kind of person you want to be.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do I know the kind of occupations in which 
        people like myself tend to find success and satisfaction?&quot; Once you 
        have examined and found out about yourself , your next question is what 
        you can really do with yourself. You can gain some idea of what other 
        people, with similar abilities and interests. consider to be important 
        and challenging in the careers that they chose , by talking to people 
        already in the careers that interest you. Watch these people at work.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have I weighed carefully the immediate 
        advantages against the longterm<br>
        prospects offered by the jobs I am considering?&quot; Will the 
        occupation you select give you satisfaction, not just when you start, 
        but in the years to come? Realize now the importance of education in all 
        fields, technical and professional. Remember that when promotion occurs, 
        preference is usually given to educated persons-other things being 
        equal.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have I talked about my job references with my 
        careers master, my parents, my teachers and my headmaster?&quot; 
        Remember they have a tremendous furid of experience from which you 
        should benefit. They can help you think about the job in which you will 
        find satisfaction and challenge. They can stimulate you to give careful 
        thought to what you really want to do, and offer useful suggestions as 
        to how you might take full advantage of your personal qualities and 
        qualification.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have I made a real study of jobs in Hong 
        Kong?&quot; It takes a very long time to find the work that suits you 
        the best. Reading about and studying a number of occupations is 
        something you should do over and over again. In Hong Kong very little 
        written material is provided about the careers available. But there is 
        some. You or your parents should obtairi it as soon as possible. Your 
        careers master will be able to help you in this, if your school has one.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How do I regard my job? Is it just a means of 
        getting money to do the things that I want to do? Is the work important 
        to me and my future happiness and contentment? Is it a combination of 
        both these things?&quot; The above questions and their answers should 
        give you some better ideas about how you should start planning your 
        career. Your life-long job cannot be approached in any kind of haphazard 
        fashion. It must be considered carefull, examined from every angle, 
        talked over with those who know you and those who can help you in any 
        way.<br>
