&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mum's first attempt at match-making ended in dismal failure. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People say as a woman approaches middle age, she interests herself in young people's love affairs and likes match-making. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If this is true, I hope this first failure would discourage Mum from acquiring such an interest. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I really don't know why she should have gone to such lengths to try to bring those two young people together. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was a fruitless and thankless job, doomed from the start because both parties put impossible demands on the opposite side. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The man, Xiao Liu, is about thirty and works in Mum's office, apparently a very promising young man with an M.A. degree. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Because he is very choosy he has never been able to find a wife and is beginning to get worried as he will soon be over thirty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The girl works in Dad's office and is twenty-eight. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She is also a college graduate and very good at her work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She is quite pretty and has a very strong character. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She too has not been able to find a husband because she is too choosy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mum had thought innocently that however choosy they might have been, they would surely be satisfied this time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So she invited them over to meet in our house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She even went to the trouble of cooking them a delicious dinner. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But Mum's pains were not rewarded. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't know how they appreciated Mum's dinner, but they certainly didn't appreciate each other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Xiao Wu could only meet two of Xiao Liu's numerous demands. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She is pretty and she has a college degree. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But besides that he also wants the girl to be under twenty-five, to be gentle and docile, a perfect housewife. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He thought Xiao Wu had too strong a character and that he wouldn't be able to "control her". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On the other hand he fared even worse in Xiao Wu's eyes, having met only one of her demands. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is a post-graduate student which is one of her prerequisites for a future husband, and this seems to be the only thing in his favour. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She wants her future husband to be an overseas Chinese, or at least to have relatives overseas, so that she could go abroad someday. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Also she wants the man to be around 1.75m in height and Xiao Liu is only 1.68m. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've heard people say that nowadays, girls consider any young man under 1.7m as a semi-handicapped! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Thank God, I'm already 1.73m and with any luck I can grow another 5cm ¡ª a most respectable height. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I don't have any relatives abroad though! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mum was most annoyed, and put all the blame on the girl. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "What more does she want? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She should realize that she's already 28 and she'll never find such an eligible young man again." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mum never mentioned a word about Xiao Liu's own objections. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Who told you to help such an arrogant young man? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Xiao Wu is a hundred times better than he is. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Any sensible young man would have jumped at the chance." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Jump at the chance! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I bet you wish you could jump at the chance yourself!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dad didn't know whether to laugh or to be angry. </T> <BR>
