&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Time talks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It speaks more plainly than words. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Time communicates in many ways. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Consider the different parts of the day, for example. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The time of the day when something is done can give a special meaning to the event. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Factory managers in the United States fully realize the importance of an announcement made during the middle of the morning or afternoon that takes everyone away from his work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Whenever they want to make an important announcement, they ask: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "When shall we let them know?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The same meaning is attached to telephone call after 11:00 p.m. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it is a matter of life or death. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In social life, time plays a very important part. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the United States, guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But this is not true in all countries. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The meanings of time differ in different parts of the world. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from cultures that treat time differently. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the U.S., no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When equals meet, a person who is five minutes late will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he may not complete the sentence. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Americans look ahead and are concerned almost entirely with the future. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The American idea of the future is limited, however. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is the foreseeable future and not the future of the South Asian, which may involve centuries. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Someone has said of the South Asian idea of time: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Time is like a museum with endless halls and rooms. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You, the viewer, are walking through the museum in the dark, holding a light to each scene as you pass it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> God is in charge of the museum, and only he knows all that is in it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One lifetime represents one room." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Since time has such different meanings in different cultures, communication is often difficult. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We will understand each other a little better if we can keep this fact in mind. </T> <BR>
