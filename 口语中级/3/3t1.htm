&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith gave his wife ten pounds for her birthday ¡ª ten pretty pound notes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So the day after her birthday, Mrs. Smith went shopping. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She queued for a bus, got on and sat down next to an old lady. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After a while, she noticed that the old lady's handbag was open. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Inside it, she saw a wad of pound notes exactly like the one her husband had given her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So she quickly looked into her own bag ¡ª the notes had gone! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Smith was sure that the old lady who was sitting next to her had stolen them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She thought she would have to call the police;  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but, as she disliked making a fuss and getting people into trouble, she decided to take back the money from the old lady's handbag and say nothing more about it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She looked round the bus to make sure nobody was watching, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> then she carefully put her hand into the old lady's bag, took the notes and put them in her own bag. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When she got home that evening, she showed her husband the beautiful hat she had bought. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How did you pay for it?" he asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "With the money you gave me for my birthday, of course," she replied. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh? What's that, then?" he asked, as he pointed to a wad of ten pound notes on the table. </T> <BR>
