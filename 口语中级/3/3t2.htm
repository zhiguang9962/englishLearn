&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Goodbye, darling," said Mr. Mackin. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I'll be late tonight." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Poor George, she thought. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was always in a hurry in the morning, and it wasn't unusual for him to come home late at night. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He worked for a shoe company in Leeds, and there was such a lot of work that he normally stayed in the office till seven or eight. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When George had left the house Mrs. Mackin sat down in an armchair and turned on the radio. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was a few minutes past eight, and she heard the last words of the news: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "... man who escaped from Leeds prison yesterday is still free. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The police warn you not to open your door to strangers." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She turned off the radio. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The housework was waiting for her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She made the beds and washed the dishes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There wasn't any shopping to do, and so she thought for a moment of all the work in the garden. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The Mackins lived in a house with a large garden in a suburb of Leeds. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Behind the garden there were some trees, and then the open fields. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Suddenly Mrs. Mackin remembered the news. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She laughed uneasily. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That prison is only fifteen miles away, she thought. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She didn't work in the garden, she mended her husband's shirts instead. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And she carefully locked the front door and closed all the windows. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It was getting dark. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She turned on the lights in the living-room. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then she noticed that she had turned on the lights in most of the rooms in the house. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How silly I am!" she said nervously and went into the other rooms and turned the lights on. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The person at the door said something loudly, but she was so frightened that she didn't understand a word. </T> <BR>
