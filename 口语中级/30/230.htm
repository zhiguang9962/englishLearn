      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspector Chester of Scotland Yard soon arrived on the 
      scene of the crime. When the newspapermen saw him getting out of the car 
      they immediately realised that matters were serious. Inspector Chester had 
      a fine reputation. He had solved many difficult and complicated crimes 
      during the last few years. Most of them were robberies. This one concerned 
      the theft of jewels belonging to a famous film actress. She was reputed to 
      be a millionairess. So it was not surprising that the missing jewels were 
      valued at a quarter of a million pounds.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newspapermen were eager to question the detective. 
      He stood on the pavement outside the house and smiled at the 
      photographers. &quot;Have you a statement to make?&quot; somebody asked. 
      The detective - tall, thick-set, middle-aged, clean-shaven pushed his way 
      through the crowd, climbed a few steps to the front door, turned round and 
      said in a cool, clear voice: &quot;I have no statement to make.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">As soon as there 
      is anything fresh to tell you, I'll let you know. &quot; He beckoned to a 
      policeman, whispered a few words in his ear and went into the house. After 
      a &quot;Move along, please&quot; from the policeman, the crowd gradually 
      dispersed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upstairs , Inspector Chester walked over to the French 
      windows. It was probably through these that the~thieves had come.They had 
      left no clues, no finger-prints. It had apparently not been difficult for 
      them to break into the safe. Just as the detective was about to examine 
      this once again, the telephone rang.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hullo, Inspector&quot;, a soft, monotonous voice 
      said. &quot;If you want a clue, why don't you talk to the servant? The one 
      with a small scar on the right cheek. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was this a trick? Would it put the Inspector on the 
      right track?<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspector Robinson was swearing aloud when he arrived 
      at the fine, old house at the top of the hill. The past few weeks had heen 
      rough for him, and it looked as if there was more trouble ahead. It was 
      raining hard , and Carruthers , his assistant, who was waiting for him at 
      the gate, was wet to the skin. As they walked up the path together, 
      Carruthers explained what had happened.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, Sylvia Fortagne, a daughter of Lord 
      Arthrington, had been found dead in the sitting-room by one of the 
      servants that evening. The police doctor, who had examined the body, was 
      sure that it was a clear case of poisoning. They had not moved the body; 
      it still lay face upwards, where it had fallen.Underneath her body they 
      had found the photograph of an unknown young man.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">There had been no 
      signs of a struggle. The woman's husband had not been seen since 
      lunchtime. According to the cook he had left the house &quot;in 
      anger&quot;, as she put it, after a quarrel with his wife, and had gone 
      for a ride on one of his favourite horses.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carruthers pushed open the front door, and the two men 
      entered the hall.Inspector Robinson took off his hat and went into the 
      sitting-room.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -We'll have to wait, said Carruthers wiping his 
      glasses. -It's no use waiting, said the Inspector. I don't think he'll 
      dare to come back. It's pretty obvious he did it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying this , he put on his hat. They were about to 
      leave the house when they saw a dark figure approaching them from out of 
      the shadows. It was Nigel Fortagne.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nigel Fortagne's story<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Yes, it's true that I knew that my wife was in love 
      with another man, but I trusted her and believed that she would forget 
      about him sooner or later. But when she returned from a weekend in Paris 
      this morning, she told me that she wanted a divorce and threatened to do 
      something terrible if I didn't agree to it. I refused, of course.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;She drank 
      heavily at lunchtime and even opened the bottle which she had brought as a 
      present for me. She insisted that I should join her for a drink, but I 
      didn't, because I had taken my medicine. I'm not supposed to take it, with 
      alcohol. I suffer from a weak heart , you see. She was in a terrible 
      state, so I put some of my pills into my glass when she wasn't looking. 
      Then I exchanged the glasses.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;It was not 
      really rriuch, but, of course, I should have known how dangerous these 
      pills can be. But at that moment I was so angry that I didn't care. I was 
      sic'k and tired of the argument and left the house.She was so drunk she 
      wouldn't have noticed any difference in the taste of the sherry. I came 
      back to see how she was. And , besides, there's no point in running away, 
      because life doesn't mean anything to me without her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      James Highsmith's story<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, James Highsmith, the young man in the 
      photograph, was questioned by Inspector Robinson. When he was told what 
      had happened he broke down.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Yes, I'm not ashamed to admit that we were in love. We 
      had a wonderful time in Paris, but I was afraid of losing her. Sylvia 
      often talked about killing him because he would never agree to a divorce. 
      I begged her not to do it, but she said that one of us had to. Then I 
      found one of his prescriptions in her hand-bag. I bought the medicine, put 
      some of it into a bottle of sherry and told Sylvia to give it to him as a 
      present.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;It was him 
      or me. I wasn't anxious about her drinking from the bottle because I was 
      fairly sure that it wasn't really enough to kill a normal, healthy 
      grown-up. I must have killed her, though, and the only comfort I can find 
      in her death is that I don't have to share her with him any longer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Sylvia Fortagne's story<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Highsmith did not know that the police had found 
      a message on a slip of paper in Sylvia Fortagne's hand-bag.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear James,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please forgive me for the terrible thing I am going to 
      do, but it's the only way out. I have considered everything carefully, and 
      I know it's very selfish, but W. has destroyed my life and made me 
      thoroughly unhappy.When you receive this letter he will have been found 
      dead after a heart attack with a glass of sherry in his hand. I tried to 
      phone you earlier this morning, but couldn't reach you. In case they 
      examine the body they will think that he took an overdose of his medicine 
      by mistake. His family will come over to comfort me and will probably stay 
      for a few weeks, so, please,don't try to get in touch. It will all be 
      worth it in the end.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All my love,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours ever,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
