      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts 
      on the Spring Festival<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first Spring Festival in north China was a bit of a 
      shock. Where was the spring? There was snow on the ground and ice on the 
      Summer Palace lake and a north-west wind was blowing. In England, where I 
      come from, we think of the flowers that bloom in the spring; the crocuses 
      and daffodils and the flowering tress - purple lilac, yellow laburnum, 
      rosy horse-chestnuts, pink and white hawthorn or may. In fact we say 
      &quot;cast not a clout till may is out &quot;. That means don't ieave off 
      any ciothes until the may flower is in bloom. By then it's warm, so you 
      won't catch cold if you shed a garment.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I had another problem. in Beijing, despite the 
      snow and ice it's often sunny over .he Spring Festival. So I liked to go 
      out; to walk in the snow round the Summer Palace lake or to skate on 
      Kunming Lake. Then we'd co~ne home and find that old friends had called on 
      us whiie we were out. So gradually we iearnt the laws of the Spring 
      Festival. The first day (chu yi </font><font color="#000080" size="4">初一 
      </font><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">) is for 
      feasting at home with the family and very ciose friends; the second and 
      third days are for paying and receiving visit So we changed our holiday 
      life style and stayed at home or called n friends those days. Of course we 
      could still go out on chu yi.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days we don't always stay in Beijing for the 
      Spring Festival ; sometimes we go on a trip to some other part of China. 
      Last year we were lucky enough to go to I-Iainan Island. Instead of 
      skating we went swimming. That was a treat. The sea-water in February was 
      warmer than it is in the middle of the summer in England. That made up for 
      those snowy, icy, windy Beijingsprings.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1983 was another memorable festival for us.A friend of 
      the Naxi national minority invited us to his home, in the mountains in 
      northwest Yunnan , 2 , 000 metres above sea-level. What a wonderful place 
      and, what wonderful people, how hospitable despite being far from wan yuan 
      hu(</font><font color="#000080" size="4">万元户）</font><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">! 
      They introduced us to their friends and relatives, as well as to their 
      ancient culture. And it goes without saying that they wined a nd dined us 
      with their fiery hot food.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">One very special 
      meal was a picnic by the graves of the ancestors. This was no English 
      style picnic with a couple of sandwiches and a bottle of beer. The 
      Mongolian-style hotpot was carried up into the hills and there was 
      a.regular feast for all three generations. But the first cup of wine was 
      placed by the grave of the clan ancestor. Why shouldn't he join in the fun 
      along with his descendants? Of course there was the usual exchange of 
      gifts. The most precious one I received was a granddaughter - or at least 
      a god-granddaughter nearly one yearold. I had nothing of comparable value 
      to offer in return.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1981 we went to Jiangxi and Fujian. The high point 
      was walking in the Wu Yi Mountains, on the border of the two provinces. 
      These mountains are not high by Chinese standards though they are higher 
      than any in Britain. But they are icleal for hiking, even when it snows , 
      as it did when we climbed them. The lower slopes are planted to tea 
      bushes; above them tower spectacular crags, sheer precipices and massive 
      rocks cleft by narrow paths You can scarcely squeeze thraugh them 
      -especially after the continuous banqueting which is hard to avoid during<br>
      the Spring Festival.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the biggest banquets are not always the best. Years 
      ago, I remember, as the festival approached, there would be a dance in the 
      students' dining hall, to which we teachers were invited. Then there was 
      the finest feast of all; great buckets and cauldrons of steaming laba zhou&lt;</font><font color="#000080" size="4">腊八粥</font><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">), 
      a thick, sweet porridge of glutinous rice full of green beans, candied 
      fruit, peanuts and lotus kernels.It wasn't these ingredients alone which 
      made the laba zhou delicious. It was the jolly atmosphere, with students, 
      teachers, cooks and cadres all enjoying themselves together.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1980 we spent the Spring Festival in Chengdu and 
      there I got another shock. On the first day of the lunar new year - we 
      visited a famous temple. The street outside the main gate was lined with 
      sellers of incense. People were queuing up by the hundred to buy it and 
      burn the incense and chant and bow, even to kowtow, as they made the 
      rounds of the temple statues. At first I felt sad. Here we were, over 30 
      years after Liberation, in a socialist country, and people were still 
      doing this!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">We discussed it 
      and concluded that it had its good side. It takes time to create a 
      scientific world outlook and these ancient practices and beli fs had 
      evidently never been rooted out. They had simply gone underground, 
      especially during the days of the Gang of Four. Nlow, four years after the 
      gang's overthrow, the people felt free and unafraid, to do in the open 
      what had been hidden in their he rts and homes. In any case, these incense 
      burners were not a cross-section of the people.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">They were mostly 
      old ladies with little bound feet, who'd been deprived of education. But 
      then with them were their grandchildren, some wearing red scarves. That 
      seemed terrible. Young Pioneers worshipping idols!In the end I realized 
      that the children didn't beIieve the idols controlled their fate. They 
      were looking after their grannies, helping them over the temple thresholds 
      and showing them the way. So I thought, that's what they'll do as they 
      grow up. They'll show their grannies the way into a modernized, socialist 
      China.</font></p>

      Christmas Day<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ on the 
      twentyfifth of December. The Christian calendar starts in the year in 
      which Jesus was born. The letters A'. D. with a year mean &quot;Anno 
      Domini&quot; or &quot;in the year of Our Lord&quot;.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas Day is a very happy day for many,boys and 
      girls. Before the term ends in some schools, the children act a nativity 
      or &quot;birth&quot; play, showing how Jesus was born in a stable.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the celebrations at Christmas are old customs. 
      Some fathers dress up in a red cloak and put on a long white beard. They 
      pretend to be Father Christmas , or Santa Claus, and put presents by the 
      beds of their children. The words Santa Claus are a way of saying Saint 
      Nicholas, a good man who helped poor people and gave presents to them more 
      than 300 years after Jesus was born.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To most Christians in Europe and America, Christmas Day 
      finishes the year, although there are still a few days left after it. Shop 
      windows are decorated with Christmas trees some months before December, 
      and notices are put up saying &quot;68 shopping days to Christmas&quot; or 
      &quot;21 shopping days to Christmas&quot;. Cotton wool is stuck on to the 
      shop windows to look like snow, and holly and mistletoe are hung up.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents buy presents for their children. Then they have 
      to hide them in the house to stop the children from finding out what 
      &quot;Father Christmas&quot; is going to bring them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the twenty-fourth of December, all children are very 
      excited. Usually they are sent to bed early so that their parents can get 
      the presentsready. The younger children think that Father Christmas will 
      come down the chimney or fireplace, so they hang up a sock for him to put 
      presents in. The greedy.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;ones even 
      hang up a pillow-case or a sack to try to get more presents. Later that 
      night, Father or Mother will put presents in the sock, and leave others at 
      the side of the bed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Christmas morning, the children wake up very early. 
      Some even turn on the light at two o'clock, and most of them are awake by 
      six o'clock although it is not light in England for another hour or two at 
      this time of the year.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hildren look for their presents, and the young ones 
      play while the dinner is prepared. At about one o'clock in the afternoon, 
      the Christmas dinner is brought in. The turkey or chicken is quickly 
      eaten. Children search in their Christmas pudding for new coins which are 
      hidden in it. The rest of the day is full of games and eating until the 
      happiest of all Christian holidays comes to an end.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the Spring Festival is over, I only have 
      school to look forward to. lt's really funny, I find myself looking 
      forward more and more to school.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual I can get little work done during the winter 
      vacation. For one thing, the Spring Festival is always a big distraction, 
      and for days before and after nobody can get any work done. It's all right 
      if you really have a nice time, as I used to. But now I find myself 
      enjoying it less and less. I stopped enjoying fireworks and firecrackers 
      years ago. The firecrackers especially get on my nerves.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I really 
      think we should stop making them, as every year many children have their 
      eyes hurt or even blinded. Even worse sometimes fires are started and 
      whole buildings get burned down. Still I suppose we'll continue to make 
      them as long as there is a market for them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the food! People spend days queuing and buying. The 
      result - too much and too rich food which does nobody any good. Chicken, 
      duck, fish, pork, beef, mutton, - name what you will. What's more they 
      become oa;eless too. Too much of a good thing, as we say. And this 
      visiting business too. It's all right for a few really good friends to get 
      together and chat over some tea or drinks.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;But mere 
      acquaintances and the usually not too neighbourly neighbours dropping in 
      to say hello-well, I suppose these are well-intended gestures, but I find 
      them a pain in the neck. Usually there is nothing to talk about except 
      some meaningless platitudes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mum is looking very tired, and no wonder Dad too, I 
      think. found the whole thing a strain. The only two who really enjoyed the 
      Spring Festival are Granny and Xiao Hong. Still Spring Festival comes only 
      once a year.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yes, I did enjoy myself skating on the nearby lake 
      quite a few times. The ice is not too good now and getting very thin. I 
      stopped going before the Spring Festival. But there are people who are 
      either too reckless or too ignorant or both, and we hear about people 
      falling through thin ice every year.<br>
