&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My first Spring Festival in north China was a bit of a shock. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Where was the spring? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was snow on the ground and ice on the Summer Palace lake and a north-west wind was blowing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In England, where I come from, we think of the flowers that bloom in the spring: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the crocuses and daffodils and the flowering trees ― purple lilac, yellow laburnum, rosy horse-chestnuts, pink and white hawthorn or may. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In fact we say "cast not a clout till may is out". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That means don't leave off any clothes until the may flower is in bloom. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> By then it's warm, so you won't catch cold if you shed a garment. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Then I had another problem. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In Beijing, despite the snow and ice it's often sunny over the Spring Festival. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So I liked to go out; to walk in the snow round the Summer Palace lake or to skate on Kunming Lake. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then we'd come home and find that old friends had called on us while we were out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So gradually we learnt the laws of the Spring Festival. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The first day (<I>chu yi</I> 初一) is for feasting at home with the family and very close friends; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the second and third days are for paying and receiving visits. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So we changed our holiday life style and stayed at home or called on friends those days. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course we could still go out on <I>chu yi.</I> </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These days we don't always stay in Beijing for the Spring Festival; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> sometimes we go on a trip to some other part of China. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Last year we were lucky enough to go to Hainan Island. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Instead of skating we went swimming. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That was a treat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The sea-water in February was warmer than it is in the middle of the summer in England. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That made up for those snowy, icy, windy Beijing springs. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 1983 was another memorable festival for us. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A friend of the Naxi national minority invited us to his home, in the mountains in northwest Yunnan, 2,000 metres above sea-level. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What a wonderful place and, what wonderful people, how hospitable despite being far from <I>wan yuan hu</I> (万元户)! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They introduced us to their friends and relatives, as well as to their ancient culture. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And it goes without saying that they wined and dined us with their fiery hot food. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One very special meal was a picnic by the graves of the ancestors. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This was no English style picnic with a couple of sandwiches and a bottle of beer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Mongolian-style hotpot was carried up into the hills and there was a regular feast for all three generations. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the first cup of wine was placed by the grave of the clan ancestor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why shouldn't he join in the fun along with his descendants? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course there was the usual exchange of gifts. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The most precious one I received was a granddaughter ― or at least a god-granddaughter nearly one year-old. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I had nothing of comparable value to offer in return. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In 1981 we went to Jiangxi and Fujian. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The high point was walking in the Wu Yi Mountains, on the border of the two provinces. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> These mountains are not high by Chinese standards, though they are higher than any in Britain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But they are ideal for hiking, even when it snows, as it did when we climbed them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The lower slopes are planted to tea bushes; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> above them tower spectacular crags, sheer precipices and massive rocks cleft by narrow paths. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You can scarcely squeeze through them ― especially after the continuous banqueting which is hard to avoid during the Spring Festival. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But the biggest banquets are not always the best. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Years ago, I remember, as the festival approached, there would be a dance in the students' dining hall, to which we teachers were invited. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then there was the finest feast of all: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> great buckets and cauldrons of steaming <I>laba zhou</I> (腊八粥), a thick, sweet porridge of glutinous rice full of green beans, candied fruit, peanuts and lotus kernels. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It wasn't these ingredients alone which made the laba zhou delicious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was the jolly atmosphere, with students, teachers, cooks and cadres all enjoying themselves together. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In 1980 we spent the Spring Festival in Chengdu and there I got another shock. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On the first day of the lunar new year ― we visited a famous temple. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The street outside the main gate was lined with sellers of incense. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People were queuing up by the hundred to buy it and burn the incense and chant and bow, even to kowtow, as they made the rounds of the temple statues. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first I felt sad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here we were, over 30 years after Liberation, in a socialist country, and people were still doing this! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We discussed it and concluded that it had its good side. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It takes time to create a scientific world outlook and these ancient practices and beliefs had evidently never been rooted out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had simply gone underground, especially during the days of the Gang of Four. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now, four years after the gang's overthrow, the people felt free and unafraid, to do in the open what had been hidden in their hearts and homes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In any case, these incense burners were not a cross-section of the people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were mostly old ladies with little bound feet, who'd been deprived of education. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But then with them were their grandchildren, some wearing red scarves. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That seemed terrible. Young Pioneers worshipping idols! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the end I realized that the children didn't believe the idols controlled their fate. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were looking after their grannies, helping them over the temple thresholds and showing them the way. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So I thought, that's what they'll do as they grow up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They'll show their grannies the way into a modernized, socialist China. </T> <BR>
