      Thieves Beware : People See You<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year car theft costs us about </font><font color="#000080" size="4">￡</font><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">300 
      million, and burglary sets us back by another </font><font color="#000080" size="4">￡</font><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">150 
      million.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the police reckon that one car in five is left 
      unlocked, or with windows open, or with expensive goods temptingly on 
      display. It is estimated that over 60% of homes still do not have any 
      window locks (although that's better than a few years ago when it was 
      nearer 90% ) .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts illustrate a basic truth.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is that most criminals are on the lookout for 
      a soft touch. They are not hardened &quot;professionals&quot; who set out 
      with particular targets in mind, but young, inexperienced or 
      unsophisticated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they're looking for is a house or car that will 
      let them get in, get what they want and get away quickly.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, an easy opportunity.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these opportunities can just as easily be 
      removed. By fitting and using locks. Or by taking other very simple 
      precautions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if we can foil small-time criminals with modest 
      individual effort and cost, how much more could be achieved by working 
      together in Neighbourhood Watches ( there are forty-two thousand already)? 
      Or in other local activities involving police, councils, businesses, 
      voluntary groups and schools?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More radically still, what might we see if more 
      systematic effort was made to design anti-crime features into cars, houses 
      and estates?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a pipe dream: it's already happening.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take housing. There is a growing awareness of how the 
      design, layout and construction of houses and estates can affect the 
      incidence of crime.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many police forces are now appointing specialist 
      architectural liaison officers in their crime prevention departments.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new British Standard has been published. Some 
      builders are now building security features&nbsp; into new housing 
      projects.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or cars. The Institute for Consumer Ergonomics at 
      I,oughborough University carried out a research project into automobile 
      security which was presented to the motor industry at a special Home 
      Office conference.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some manufacturers are now fitting better security on 
      the production line. Some magazine road tests regularly report on the 
      subject.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 95% of crirnes are against property rather than 
      people. But, not surprisingly, it is the remaining 5% --assault, mugging 
      and rape, for example-that causes the most comment and concern.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even thugs look for easy opportunities. The dark 
      alley,<br>
      the pensioner who doesn't check callers' credentials, the child who 
      accepts a lift from a stranger. These can be reduced by personal and 
      community action.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, because all of us feel vulnerable 
      sometimes, police and other experts have devised simple, sensible 
      precaution which individuals can adopt to help minimise the risk of being<br>
      attacked.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't miss the neighbourhood watch people, or 
      &quot;old auntie&quot;. as they are sometimes called. As in neighbourhoods 
      all over Beijing. they wear red armbands and sit on small chairs in lances 
      off Wenjia Street downtown.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a stranger there and your behaviour arouses 
      their suspicion, you are likely to be stopped for questions, such as whom 
      you are looking for and where you are from.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You needn't worry about theft if you live in the area 
      and forget to lock the door of your house; the aunties will lock it during 
      their daily inspection tour past every house in -the community. But 
      remember, a severe criticism of your carelessness will follow.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their presence may be one reason the 426-household 
      community with about 1,200 residents has been free from theft, burglary 
      and other criminal acts for almost 10 years.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every community member is encouraged by their 
      neighbourhood residents' committee to remain alert for possible theft and 
      to contribute an individual effort to the maintenance of a safe 
      environment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wenjia Street neighbourhood residents' committee 
      runs a public security committee together with committees on mediation, 
      publie health, and women's affairs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; They all look inconspicuous, yet their functions 
      are great,&quot; cammented a public order official from the Ministry of 
      Public Security.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The official's comment is understandable. since the 
      neighbourhood committees have proved to be an effective approach to 
      maintaining public order and ensuring public safety at a time when 
      professional police are in short supply.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Wenjia public security committee, for instance, 
      in addition to six directors, there are 138 residents who act as amateur 
      police for the neighbourhood.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except the six directors, who receive 45 yuan monthly 
      from he government, the neighbours work voluntarily. They form a small but 
      sensitive security network in their community.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the 138, 54 are retired workers or older 
      housewives, whose job is to take turns guarding the 42 courtyards of 
      houses in the community.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Ran Yuzhen, the committee director, the 
      whole community has been divided into 35 groups, with 62 people appointed 
      to be group leaders.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; Every community member is involved in the 
      security work,&quot; said Ran.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety is maintained in a number of ways.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, patrols by professional police.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, daily inspection tours around the community by 
      six committee directors.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The directors keep a log of their observations while 
      inspecting the neighbourhood.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, guarding of courtyards and houses by the 
      retirees and housewives.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, installation of burglar-proof locks.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Safety is possible with the participation o# 
      every member in the community involved in the security work,&quot; said 
      Ran.<br>
      <br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu Xiuli was not boasting when he said he was a 
      top-notch policeman. &quot;1 catch thieves. I know their tricks and always 
      make a big haul. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu. 42, works with the Criminal Investigation 
      Department of the Municipal<br>
      Public Security Bureau of Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He 
      heads a special task force to catch thieves and pickpockets on crowded 
      buses and other public places.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The thieves are very much afraid of me,&quot; he 
      said. &quot;Whenever they recognize<br>
      me, they run off as a rat fears a cat. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his long experience, Lu can recall from memory the 
      names and nicknames of more than 1,000 thieves or pickpockets in the city. 
      He can list their physical characteristics and knows their haunts and 
      tricks of the trade. He always carries a small notebook with information 
      about major suspects. This has helped him spot them when they are on the 
      prowl.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typical pickpockets are unemployed urban youth aged 
      between 18 and 25, Lu said. They have grown up and are quite independent 
      of their parents. But they do not yet have their own families. And they do 
      not care much about the consequences of their activities.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their targets are usually tourists or travelling 
      traders from outside the city, not only because these people often carry a 
      lot of money but also they are only transients who know little about local 
      conditions. Thieves usually avoid locals for fear that they may come 
      across them some other day and, even if they were not caught in the act, 
      they may be recognized sooner or later.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have learned to spot pickpockets on a crowded 
      bus by the distinctive ways they move,&quot; Lu said. Many pickpockets on 
      a bus choose their targets when passengers expose the location of their 
      wallet as they take out money to pay the fare. The pickpocket edges 
      towards his victim asking, people to make way as if he wanted to get off 
      the bus. But he stops next to the target and raising one hand to grip the 
      overhead bar, slips the other into the person's pocket and deftly removes 
      the money using only index and middle fingers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pickpockets are usually not dangerous criminals, but 
      sometimes Lu has to fight them face to face in a life and death struggle. 
      Because he has shown no mercy in dealing with thieves, many of them are 
      waiting for a chance to take their revenge. Some even threatened him. 
      &quot;Don't be too harsh on us or sooner or later we will settle with 
      you,&quot; warned one.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lu is not to be intimidated. &quot;I'm a people's 
      policeman and will never recoil in fear before enemies,&quot; he said. 
      &quot;To protect the people's interests, I am ready to shed my blood and 
      even sacrifice my life. &quot; In his nine years of police career, Lu 
      scuffled with criminals 29 times and was injured three times.<br>
