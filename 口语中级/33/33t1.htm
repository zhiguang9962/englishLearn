&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Each year car theft costs us about ¡ê300 million, and burglary sets us back by another ¡ê150 million. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Yet the police reckon that one car in five is left unlocked, or with windows open, or with expensive goods temptingly on display. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is estimated that over 60% of homes still do not have any window locks (although that's better than a few years ago when it was nearer 90%). </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These facts illustrate a basic truth. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The truth is that most criminals are on the lookout for a soft touch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They are not hardened "professionals" who set out with particular targets in mind, but young, inexperienced or unsophisticated. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What they're looking for is a house or car that will let them get in, get what they want and get away quickly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In short, an easy opportunity. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many of these opportunities can just as easily be removed. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> By fitting and using locks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Or by taking other very simple precautions. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And if we can foil small-time criminals with modest individual effort and cost, how much more could be achieved by working together in Neighbourhood Watches (there are forty-two thousand already)? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Or in other local activities involving police, councils, businesses, voluntary groups and schools? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> More radically still, what might we see if more systematic effort was made to design anti-crime features into cars, houses and estates? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This is not a pipe dream: it's already happening. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Take housing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There is a growing awareness of how the design, layout and construction of houses and estates can affect the incidence of crime. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many police forces are now appointing specialist architectural liaison officers in their crime prevention departments. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A new British Standard has been published. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some builders are now building security features into new housing projects. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Or cars. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Institute for Consumer Ergonomics at Loughborough University carried out a research project into automobile security which was presented to the motor industry at a special Home Office conference. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some manufacturers are now fitting better security on the production line. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some magazine road tests regularly report on the subject. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> About 95% of crimes are against property rather than people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But, not surprisingly, it is the remaining 5% ¡ª assault, mugging and rape, for example ¡ª that causes the most comment and concern. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But even thugs look for easy opportunities. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The dark alley, the pensioner who doesn't check callers' credentials, the child who accepts a lift from a stranger. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> These can be reduced by personal and community action. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For example, because all of us feel vulnerable sometimes, police and other experts have devised simple, sensible precautions which individuals can adopt to help minimise the risk of being attacked. </T> <BR>
