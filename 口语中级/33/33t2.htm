&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> You can't miss the neighbourhood watch people, or "Old Aunties", as they are sometimes called. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As in neighbourhoods all over Beijing, they wear red armbands and sit on small chairs in lanes off Wenjia Street downtown. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If you are a stranger there and your behaviour arouses their suspicion, you are likely to be stopped for questions, such as whom you are looking for and where you are from. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You needn't worry about theft if you live in the area and forget to lock the door of your house; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the aunties will lock it during their daily inspection tour past every house in the community. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But remember, a severe criticism of your carelessness will follow. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Their presence may be one reason the 426-household community with about 1,200 residents has been free from theft, burglary and other criminal acts for almost 10 years. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Every community member is encouraged by their neighbourhood residents' committee to remain alert for possible theft and to contribute an individual effort to the maintenance of a safe environment. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The Wenjia Street neighbourhood residents' committee runs a public security committee together with committees on mediation, public health, and women's affairs. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "They all look inconspicuous, yet their functions are great," commented a public order official from the Ministry of Public Security. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The official's comment is understandable, since the neighbourhood committees have proved to be an effective approach to maintaining public order and ensuring public safety at a time when professional police are in short supply. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In the Wenjia public security committee, for instance, in addition to six directors, there are 138 residents who act as amateur police for the neighbourhood. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Except the six directors, who receive 45 yuan monthly from the government, the neighbours work voluntarily. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They form a small but sensitive security network in their community. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Among the 138, 54 are retired workers or older housewives, whose job is to take turns guarding the 42 courtyards of houses in the community. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> According to Ran Yuzhen, the committee director, the whole community has been divided into 35 groups, with 62 people appointed to be group leaders. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Every community member is involved in the security work," said Ran. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Safety is maintained in a number of ways. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> First, patrols by professional police. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Second, daily inspection tours around the community by six committee directors. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The directors keep a log of their observations while inspecting the neighbourhood. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Third, guarding of courtyards and houses by the retirees and housewives. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Fourth, installation of burglar-proof locks. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Safety is possible with the participation of every member in the community involved in the security work," said Ran. </T> <BR>
