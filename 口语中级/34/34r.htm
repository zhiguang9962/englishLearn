&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, I can't help thinking how magic languages are. They are like bridges joining islands ¡ª connecting people's minds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, whenever I am in the classroom, at lectures or practising English or French, I often think of my experiences at the 11th Asian Games held in Beijing last autumn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was assigned interpreter to the sports delegation from The Maldives, a small island country in the Indian Ocean. When I met the delegation at the Beijing Airport I was greatly surprised to find they all spoke English fluently. We were so excited when we realized that we were talking to each other in a language that was not native to either of us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the Games, one of "my" delegation, Shijiao, developed some eye trouble. The Games Village doctor thought it was infectious and said he should go to the infectious diseases hospital, and I was asked to take him. A Sikh from the Indian delegation went with us. He was suspected of having hepatitis. At the hospital I helped the doctor and nurse get Shijiao settled down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next day, the hospital called to say that Shijiao's eye trouble was not serious and there was no need for him to stay in hospital. So I immediately went to fetch him out. We were about to leave the hospital when a nurse hurried over to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are you the interpreter?" she asked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Could you please help us. The Indian patient you brought in with you yesterday, you know, we can't communicate with him. Nobody in the hospital speaks English."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "All right. Let's see if I can be of help."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shijiao and I followed her to the Sikh's ward. Three doctors and nurses were around his bed, trying to get through to him with gestures and a few English words. They were very relieved to see me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I asked the Indian, "Can I help you?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But he replied in a language I had never heard before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "English! English! Don't you speak English?" I asked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed he knew the word "English", for he shook his head. I didn't know what to do now. It was beyond me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then Shijiao started speaking in a strange language. It was so funny. How come? The native tongue in The Maldives is Devehi, certainly not a language in India. Shijiao turned to me and said, "My parents came from India. I speak a little Hindi."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That was great. The examination started. The doctors told me in Chinese what they wanted to know. I translated it into English. Shijiao told the patient in Hindi. The Sikh answered in Hindi. Shijiao told me in English, and I put it into Chinese for the doctors.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The examination took a full hour. The doctors and the patient were very happy, for at last they could communicate with each other. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When all the questioning was over, the doctor who seemed to be in charge took my hand and Shijiao's hand and said in Chinese. "Thank you very much." Then the patient smiled at me and said, "Tan Kiu." (Thank you)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was such an exciting and stimulating experience. I felt how good it was to be an interpreter.<BR>
