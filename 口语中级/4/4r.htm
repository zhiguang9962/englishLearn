&nbsp; &nbsp; Here is what happened to Adrian Fox on the train one day:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Adrian Fox lives in Devon and he is travelling home from London by train. He decides to have a cup of tea, and goes to the train buffet. While he is drinking his tea, an attractive girl comes and sits at the same table. They begin talking and the girl tells Adrian she is going to Devon on holiday. They are soon very friendly. Adrian finds out that the girl hasn't yet found a hotel to stay in. Adrian's mother has a spare room in her house, and Adrian invites the girl to stay there. He knows his mother won't mind. The girl accepts.<BR>

His mother won't like to have two people staying in her house. Then three children arrive. Two of them are carrying cats, and one has a small dog. They are the girl's children. They are all very happy, the girl says, to be staying in Adrian's mother's house. But Adrian isn't so happy. When he reaches the station he phones his mother...<BR>
