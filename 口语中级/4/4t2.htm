&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of all the men who ever liked fresh air, not one liked it more than James Wilson. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He took long walks in the fresh air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He ran long distances in the fresh air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He played football and other games in the fresh air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He liked to climb mountains and breathe the fresh air at the top. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He used to go to sit by the sea and watch the great waves in the fresh air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He always slept with his windows wide open. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had an open car with no roof, and he drove it madly through the fresh air. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If Wilson entered a room where the windows were shut, he immediately opened them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He did this even when snow was falling outside. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If someone else shut the windows again, he walked out of the room in a manner which showed his opinions without any doubt. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When he travelled by sea, he could usually be found in a place on board where the wild wind was blowing through his hair. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One winter Wilson went to Finland on business. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Good hotels in Finland are heated during the cold winter, and this winter was even colder than usual. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When Wilson reached his room in the hotel, he found that the windows were closed to keep the icy air out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He did his best to open one, but failed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was absolutely impossible to open it: the manager had very wisely arranged that. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Wilson undressed and got into bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was a very angry man. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The bedroom was very pleasant. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Two or three pictures on the walls showed views of some beautiful parts of Finland. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was no noise at all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The bed was really excellent, but Wilson could not sleep. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could not forget the closed window. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No fresh air! It was terrible to think of! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He got out of bed and tried once more to open the window; but it was useless, and he sadly got back into bed. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> At about one o'clock in the morning he was still awake, worrying about the air in the bedroom. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had turned over in bed two hundred and thirty-six times. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was very hot. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As he turned over for the two hundred and thirty-seventh time, one arm came out of the bedclothes and hung down beside the bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His hand touched the floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It also touched something on the floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This thing was a shoe. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> An idea came into his worried mind. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Angry men act quickly, and the shoe was in his hand in less than a second. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Where was the window? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could see something that looked like glass over there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He threw the shoe through the darkness with all the force of his strong right arm. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The shoe flew straight through the air and hit the glass in the middle. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A terrible sound of breaking glass filled the bedroom, but to Wilson's sad heart it seemed like the sound of sweet and beautiful music. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Now I have some fresh air in the room," he thought. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Now I need not die." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Five minutes later he was peacefully asleep. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He did not move for many hours. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When daylight came gently through the window, he awoke and lay with his eyes closed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Where was he? Oh, yes! He was in Finland; but what was the matter? Was anything wrong? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was something to worry about. What was it? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Oh, the broken window! Yes, indeed. He would have to pay for that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How much? Was it a big piece of glass? He could not remember. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He opened his eyes to look. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Slowly he turned them towards the window, and then he sat up suddenly in bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was very surprised: the window was not broken at all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The glass was all in one piece, just as good as it had been the night before. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No fresh air was entering the room through that window. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What, then, had happened when he threw the shoe? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He turned his eyes to the side and saw a broken picture hanging on the wall. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was a shoe on the floor below it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could see a lot of broken glass round the shoe, and there was more inside it. </T> <BR>
