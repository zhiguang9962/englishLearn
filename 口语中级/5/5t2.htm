&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Teresa went up to Mrs. Webster's room, two stairs at a time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was nearly at the top when she stopped and sniffed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A strong smell of gas was coming from that direction. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Teresa ran up the remaining stairs and threw open the door. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She put her hands over her mouth to stop a scream. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Webster was lying on the floor near the sink. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her skin and lips had a pinkish colour and she appeared to be unconscious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The room was full of gas. </T> <BR>
