JOAN: Yes, madam? Can I help you?<BR>
MRS. S: Oh yes, please, but you're just closing, aren't you?<BR>
JOAN: Well, yes, we are, madam. The shop shuts in five minutes.<BR>
MRS. S: I shan't keep you long then. It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week.<BR>
JOAN: Last week, madam? I really can't remember which ones you mean. What were they like?<BR>
MRS. S: Oh, they were lovely! Sort of imitation wood, dark brown colour, country-style, you know, and the lids, if I remember rightly, had a sort of leaf pattern, or was it flowers?<BR>
JOAN: That's strange. I don't recognise any of the ones we had from that description. Are you sure they were in this shop?<BR>
MRS. S: Oh, you must know the ones I mean. They were in a sale. A real bargain. Reduced to a quarter of the original price. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them.<BR>
JOAN: I'm afraid the sales are over now, madam, and I know we sold out of all the saucepans.<BR>
MRS. S: I don't think you did, you know. At least, my neighbour, Mrs. Cliffe, told me she saw some here only yesterday.<BR>
JOAN: Well, it's all new stock in the window now.<BR>
MRS. S: May I just have a look, to see if there's anything else?<BR>
JOAN: Er, well, madam, as you know, we were just closing.<BR>
MRS. S: Yes, yes, I'm sorry I won't keep you. It must get on your nerves when customers come in right on closing-time. But they were such beautiful saucepans! I'd have bought them then if only I'd made up my mind on the spot.<BR>
JOAN: Perhaps, madam, if you came back tomorrow, I could show you all we have in our range of kitchen ware. And there are still one or two things at sale price.<BR>
MRS. S: Oh look! That one there! That's the sort of thing I was looking for! But it's not quite the right colour.<BR>
JOAN: That might be the artificial lighting, madam. Of course, if you came back in daylight, you might find it's exactly what you're looking for.<BR>
MRS. S: There it is! That's the pattern! The set behind you! Thank goodness they haven't been sold! And thank you so much for being so patient with me. Yes, those are the ones!<BR>
