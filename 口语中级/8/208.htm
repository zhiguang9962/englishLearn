      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hal Bohlman, his wife Judy, and their three children 
      live in a small apartment. Hal works in the income tax division of the 
      government where he is a public information officer. Their children are 
      now 12, 10 and 5 years old. Their plan is for Judy to return to work after 
      their youngest child .starts elementary school next year. They hope to 
      save up enough money to buy a house, since they feel their present two 
      bedroom apartment is much too crowded.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, however,Judy's father died suddenly of a 
      heart attack. They now have to decide what to do about Judy's mother,since 
      Judy is the only child. Judy's father was the manager of a store in a 
      large supermarket chain, so her mother will receive a modest but 
      sufficient pension from the company. In addition, he will receive the 
      money from her husband's life insurance and will continue to receive 
      social welfare benefits from the government. In order to avoid inheritance 
      taxes, her husband in his will left his estate to Judy with the provision 
      that his wife would have use of it as long as she lived.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy realizes that it would probably be dangerous for 
      her mother to live alone. Although her health is basically good for 
      someone her age, 73, she has bad days when her heart or arthritis acts up. 
      Judy is afraid she might have trouble taking care of herself now that she 
      is alone. She is living in the house that she and her husband owned . a 
      three bedroom house in the suburbs of the same city where Hal and Judy 
      live.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hal and Judy's mother never got along well in the past 
      . but Hal rcalizes that Judy is worried about her mother.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The huge population of China is indeed a very serious 
      problem.The government has made great efforts to control the birth rate in 
      recent years.'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the work has encountered strong resistance, 
      especially in rural areas, where both economy and culture are still very 
      backward , resulting in the birthrate rising again.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people blame this on the feudal tradition that it 
      was good to have more children to have more working hands. However.<br>
      this is only half the story. In the countryside there are no pensions and 
      no free medical care for the aged. Many young couples are afraid that once 
      they are old. there will he nobody to care for them. So they want a son 
      who can tend them all their lives.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we raise more funds for the elderly in rural areas 
      and build more sanatoriums and other institutions for them, the farmers 
      can put their minds at rest.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of young couples nowadays are well 
      educated even in the poverty-stricken areas. Although the feudal influence 
      is strong, they can understand the importance of family planning. What 
      worries them most is their own old age.<br>
