&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The huge population of China is indeed a very serious problem. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The government has made great efforts to control the birth rate in recent years. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But the work has encountered strong resistance, especially in rural areas, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> where both economy and culture are still very backward, resulting in the birthrate rising again. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many people blame this on the feudal tradition that it was good to have more children to have more working hands. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> However, this is only half the story. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the countryside there are no pensions and no free medical care for the aged. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many young couples are afraid that once they are old, there will be nobody to care for them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So they want a son who can tend them all their lives. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If we raise more funds for the elderly in rural areas and build more sanatoriums and other institutions for them, the farmers can put their minds at rest. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The majority of young couples nowadays are well educated even in the poverty-stricken areas. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Although the feudal influence is strong, they can understand the importance of family planning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What worries them most is their own old age. </T> <BR>
