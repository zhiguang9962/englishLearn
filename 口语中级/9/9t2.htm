&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Today my cousin paid us a visit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She is a technician working in an electronics factory. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She has been very unhappy recently because of a quarrel with her boss. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It all started when she was denied a chance to go abroad for a training course. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> By qualification she was the ideal choice ¡ª a college degree, a working knowledge of English and generally acknowledged as very good in her field. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the final choice fell on a young man inferior to her in every respect. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Naturally she was very upset and wanted to know why. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her boss who in fact quite liked her told her quite candidly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We did think of sending you but decided against it because you are a girl." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The answer infuriated her all the more and she accused him of sex discrimination. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The best explanation she could get out of him was that it would not be "convenient" for a girl to be on her own in a foreign country as there was only one vacancy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Not convenient for whom? For herself? She didn't mind. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For her fellow trainees? That's sheer nonsense. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For her boss? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How and in what way? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Poor girl, I quite sympathize with her, but that women are at a disadvantage is a reality she'll have to face. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I told her that our form master was telling us only the other day that girls shouldn't aim too high in choosing their future speciality or choosing a university. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Certain subjects and certain departments are almost closed to them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They'll have to have 10 or more marks than the boys in order to be accepted. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "And it's not only the colleges and universities," Mum explained with anger. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "All organizations and work units are equally bad in sex discrimination when taking in new employees. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One's sex is more important than one's other qualities, it seems. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some departments take in women just as if they are forced to buy some inferior goods. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The bargaining that goes on just makes me sick. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You want to buy a carton of high-grade cigarettes? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Very well, you must buy three packs of the cheap brand as well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So if you want to assign one girl to our department, you must give us two boys as well. It's really disgusting!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I don't blame them really," said Dad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "However good a girl is, when she marries, trouble begins. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> First there is this long maternity leave. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then there'll be constant leaves because there will always be this or that wrong with her darling baby. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even when she works she will be constantly thinking of her darling child or knitting for him or her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And she becomes petty too, breaking into tears at the slightest provocation and quarrelling with others over trifles". </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This naturally brought a barrage of protests and condemnations from the two women in the room who almost tore him to pieces. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the end it was Granny who came to his rescue. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Well, a woman's place is at home, as I always say. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And what do you want to go abroad for, child? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Think of all the dangers! How can girls cope with them? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think your leaders were quite right in not letting you go." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh Granny, you don't know anything at all! You are still living in the old world. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It seems our future lies in the future generation," my cousin said pointedly to Dad, referring to me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Actually she is only ten years older than me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Equality of the sexes is certainly a very complicated problem. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just having equal rights to vote and equal pay for equal work have not solved the problem, not by a long shot. </T> <BR>
