&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A woman was having some trouble with her heart, so she went to see the doctor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was a new doctor, and did not know her, so he first asked some questions, and one of them was, "How old are you?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well," she answered, "I don't remember, doctor, but I will try to think." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She thought for a minute and then said, "Yes, I remember now, doctor! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I married, I was eighteen years old, and my husband was thirty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now my husband is sixty, I know. And that is twice thirty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So I am twice eighteen. That is thirty-six, isn't it?" </T> <BR>
