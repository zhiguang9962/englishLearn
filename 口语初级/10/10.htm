      A Beautiful Dress<br> 
      </font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
      One day Mrs Jones went shopping. When her husband came home in the  
      evening, she began to tell him about a beautiful cotton dress. &quot;I saw  
      it in a shop this morning,&quot; she said, &quot;and...&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And you want to buy it,&quot; said her husband.  
      &quot;How much does it cost? &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Forty pounds. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Forty pounds for a cotton dress? That is too  
      much!&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But every evening, when Mr Jones came back from work,  
      his wife continued to speak only abou't the dress, and at last, after a  
      week, he said, &quot;Oh, buy the dress! Here is the money!&quot; She was  
      very happy.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the next evening, when Mr Jones came home and  
      asked, &quot;Have you got the famous dress?&quot; she said, &quot;No.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why not?&quot; he said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, it was still in the window of the shop  
      after a week, so I thought, nobody else wants this dress, so I don't want  
      it either. &quot;<br>

      her husband came back from work. She was wearing dirty, old clothes and no  
      stockings, her hair was not tidy, she had dust on her face, and she looked  
      dirty and tired. Her husband looked at her and said, &quot;Is this what I  
      come home to see after a hard day's work?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Jones's neighbour, Mrs Smit.h, was there. When she  
      heard Mr Jones's words , she quickly said. goodbye and ran back to her  
      house. Then she washed, brushed and combed her hair carefully, put on her  
      best dress and her prettiest stockings, painted her face, and waited for  
      her husband to come home.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he arrived, he was hot and tired. He walked slowly  
      into the house, saw his wife and stopped. Then he shouted angrily,
