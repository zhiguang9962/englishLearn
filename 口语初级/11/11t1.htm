&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dave's class at school were studying English history, and one day their teacher said to them, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Well, boys, on Friday we're all going to get on a bus and go to Conway. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There's a beautiful castle there, and we're going to visit it." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The boys were very happy when they heard this. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Now, has anybody got any questions?" the teacher asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How old is the castle, sir?" Dave asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "It's about seven hundred years old, Dave," the teacher answered. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "What's the name of the castle, sir?" another boy asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Conway Castle," the teacher said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> On Friday the boys came to school at 9 o'clock and got into the bus. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They visited Conway Castle, and then they came back and went home. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well," Dave's mother said to him when he got home, "did you like the castle, Dave?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Not very much," Dave answered. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The stupid people built it too near the railway." </T> <BR>
