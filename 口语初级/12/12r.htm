<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a beautiful spring morning. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the sun was warm but not too hot, so Mr. Andrews was surprised when he saw an old gentleman at the bus-stop with a big, strong black umbrella in his hand.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     Mr. Andrews said to him, "Are we going to have rain today, do you think?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     "No," said the old gentleman, "I don't think so."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     "Then are you carrying the umbrella to keep the sun off you?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     "No, the sun is not very hot in spring."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     Mr. Andrews looked at the big umbrella again, and the gentleman said, "I am an old man, and my legs are not very strong, so I really need a walking-stick. But when I carry a walking-stick, people say,¡®Look at that poor old man,¡¯and I don't like that. When I carry an umbrella in fine weather, people only say,¡®Look at that stupid man.'"
