&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> At five feet six inches, Rosa was taller than every other student in the sixth grade. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She worried about this all the time, in school and at home. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her mother told her to stand up straight and be proud that she was so tall and slim. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Someday," her mother said, "you'll be happy that you're tall." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This made Rosa happier, but she was still afraid her classmates were making fun of her behind her back. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One day, all this changed when Mr. Ransom, the coach from the youth club, asked Rosa to play center on their basketball team. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He said that Rosa was a good ball player and her height would make her valuable as center. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now, she really was proud to be tall. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was someone special. </T> <BR>
