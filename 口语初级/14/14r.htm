<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ellen walked briskly out into the yard and took a deep breath of cool, fresh air. She was eager to begin work. This time of year, with the new growth everywhere, always made her feel that she had to help things grow. She gathered her tools and went to the patch of freshly turned earth and began to dig rows of holes. Then she carefully picked up one fragile plant and placed it in a hole. Over and over she performed this same task and then gently patted the earth around each plant. Her growling stomach and the sun high overhead told her when it was time to take a break.
