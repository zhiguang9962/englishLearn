&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Jones was very angry with his wife, and she was very angry with her husband. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For several days they did not speak to each other at all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One evening Mr. Jones was very tired when he came back from work, so he went to bed soon after dinner. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course, he did not say anything to Mrs. Jones before he went upstairs. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Jones washed the dinner things and then did some sewing. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When she went up to bed much later than her husband, she found a piece of paper on the small table near her bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On it were the words, "Mother ！ Wake me up at 7 a.m. ！ Father." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When Mr. Jones woke up the next morning, it was nearly 8 a.m. ！ and on the small table near his bed he saw another piece of paper. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He took it and read these words: "Father. ！ Wake up. It is 7 a.m. ！ Mother." </T> <BR>
