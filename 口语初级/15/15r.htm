<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; First Frenchman: I once heard someone shout, "Look out." I put my head out of a window and a bucketful of water fell on me. It seems that "look out" may mean "don't look out."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Second F: I was once on a ship and heard the captain shout, "All hands on deck." I put my hands on the deck and someone walked on them.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Third F: I once called early on an English friend and the maid who came to the door said, "He's not up yet. Come back in half an hour." When I went again for him, she said, "He's not down yet." I said, "If he's not up and he's not down, where is he?" She said, "He's still in bed. When I say 'He's not up' I mean he has not yet got up, so he has not yet come downstairs."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    What did these phrases mean in their respective contexts?
