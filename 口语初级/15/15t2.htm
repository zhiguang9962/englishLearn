&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Rose left school when she was seventeen and went to a college for a year to learn to type. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She passed her examinations quite well and then went to look for work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was still living with her parents. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A lot of people were looking for typists at that time, so it was not difficult to find interesting work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Rose went to several offices, and then chose one of them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was near her parents' house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She thought, "I'll walk there every morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I won't need to go by bus." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She went to the office again and said to the manager, "I want to work here, but what will you pay me?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "We'll pay you 27 pounds now," the manager answered, "and 30 pounds after three months." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Rose thought for a few seconds before she answered. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then she said, "All right, then I'll start in three months' time." </T> <BR>
