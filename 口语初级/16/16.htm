      <strong>The Charcoal Pit</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erika was worried. Her restaurant was losing customers.  
      The new restaurant across the street now had more customers than she did.  
      She had even seen some of her own customers going to eat at The Charcoal  
      Pit. What was she going to do?<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing she could do was revise her menu. Maybe not  
      everyone wanted hamburgers. She might add omelets and casseroles. The menu  
      might help.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the decor of her restaurant was dated. She  
      could redecorate the place. Erika decided to consult an interior decorator  
      who could give her some new ideas. A face-lift for Burger Haven would  
      certainly lift her spirits.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, she felt better after thinking of some  
      improvements. Erika would fight to make her restaurant the most popular  
      one in town.<br>

      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I looked out the window and saw the snow drift in  
      the driveway, I thought to myself that I should never have gotten out of  
      bed. I had been making preparatioris for more than two days for a large  
      dinner party to bc held that night and knew that several of the people I  
      was expecting to come would be calling to cancel if the snow continued  
      much longer. I called upstairs to tell Jerry to look out the window. Jerry  
      heard me and quickly got out of bed. He knew that the weather people had  
      been predicting snow. Now it had really come. To Jerry, two or three  
      inches of fresh snow would be just what was needed to make the ski trip a  
      big success.</font></p>
