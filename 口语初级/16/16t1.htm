&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Erika was worried. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her restaurant was losing customers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The new restaurant across the street now had more customers than she did. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She had even seen some of her own customers going to eat at The Charcoal Pit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What was she going to do? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One thing she could do was revise her menu. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Maybe not everyone wanted hamburgers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She might add omelets and casseroles. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The menu might help. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps the decor of her restaurant was dated. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She could redecorate the place. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Erika decided to consult an interior decorator who could give her some new ideas. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A face-lift for Burger Haven would certainly lift her spirits. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In fact, she felt better after thinking of some improvements. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Erika would fight to make her restaurant the most popular one in town. </T> <BR>
