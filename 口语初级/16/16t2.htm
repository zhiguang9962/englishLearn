&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Tina and Leela are talking to each other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They are standing outside a dance-hall and they are talking about dancing. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TINA: I haven't danced for a long time. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LEELA: Neither have I. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TINA: We must go to a dance soon, or we'll forget how to dance. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LEELA: Yes, we must. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What have you been doing since I last saw you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TINA: I've been studying hard for my examinations. And you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LEELA: I've been learning Japanese every evening. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TINA: Why have you been learning Japanese? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why not English? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LEELA: I hope to visit Japan next year. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TINA: Well, we'll both have to start learning all the new dances. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LEELA: Yes, let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TINA: A good idea. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They can teach elephants to dance nowadays: perhaps there's hope for us! </T> <BR>
