&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The country schoolhouse was three miles from my uncle's farm. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It stood in a clearing in the woods and would hold about twenty-five boys and girls. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We attended the school with more or less regularity once or twice a week in summer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We walked to it in the cool of the morning by the forest paths, and back in the dusk at the end of the day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All the pupils brought their dinners in baskets ¡ª corn dodger, buttermilk, and other good things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We sat in the shade of the trees at noon and ate them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is the part of my education which I look back upon with the most satisfaction. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My first visit to the school was when I was seven. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A strapping girl of fifteen, in the customary sunbonnet and calico dress, asked me if I "used tobacco" ¡ª meaning did I chew it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I said no. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It roused her scorn. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She reported me to all the crowd, and said: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Here is a boy seven years old who can't chew tobacco." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I learned to smoke fairly well, but that did not win over anybody. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I remained a poor thing, and characterless. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I longed to be respected, but I never was able to rise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Children have but little charity for one another's defect. </T> <BR>
