      A Lesson to Learn<br> 
      </font> 
      </strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was the only son of a wealthy American  
      businessman. Usually he was taken to school by the chauffeur in his  
      father's beautiful car, before the chauffeur took John's father to his  
      office. One evening his father told him that he had to go to the airport  
      early the next day, so he would need the car at the time that John had to  
      go to school. He said that John's mother, who possessed another car, would  
      still be in bed at the time he had to leave the house .<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well , how will I get to school if you need your  
      car and Mummy is still in bed?&quot; John asked. His father thought this  
      was a good opportunity to teach him a lesson about how hard life was for  
      the less fortunate people of the world , so he answered , &quot;You'll go  
      in the same way as every other child in the world goes-in a taxi. &quot;<br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">7. Read the following passage once. Underline the key words while  
      reading and retell the story to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd heard all the hammering behind the Marsey's house.  
      He went to see what was going on. Jeff Marsey was making something from  
      long pieces of wood.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What is it?&quot; Todd asked.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A pair of stilts,&quot; Jeff said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd knew that stilts could make you several feet  
      taller. Jeff was putting blocks of wood on the stilts. These were for his  
      feet to rest on. Once you got used to them, you could walk anywhere on  
      stilts.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm also making a pair of long pants,&quot; Jeff  
      said. &quot;They'll come all the way down and cover the stilts. I'll look  
      like a giant. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the summer went on, Todd forgot all about the  
      stilts.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night Todd was watching television. His cousin came  
      running in the front door. He'd never seen her so excited.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You'd better call the police , &quot; she said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why?&quot; asked Todd.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was walking home,&quot; she said. &quot;I  
      looked up and saw a -a giant. He was following me. He wore big baggy  
      pants. He was very stiff and straight. Each step was a huge step. I'm  
      going to call the police. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wait,&quot; said Todd. &quot;It wasn't a giant.  
      You'll be surprised when I tell you who it was!&quot;<br>
