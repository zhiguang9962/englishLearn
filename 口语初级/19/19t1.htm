&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> John was the only son of a wealthy American businessman. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Usually he was taken to school by the chauffeur in his father's beautiful car, before the chauffeur took John's father to his office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One evening his father told him that he had to go to the airport early the next day, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> so he would need the car at the time that John had to go to school. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He said that John's mother, who possessed another car, would still be in bed at the time he had to leave the house. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, how will I get to school if you need your car and Mummy is still in bed?" John asked. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His father thought this was a good opportunity to teach him a lesson about how hard life was for the less fortunate people of the world, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> so he answered, "You'll go in the same way as every other child in the world goes ¡ª in a taxi." </T> <BR>
