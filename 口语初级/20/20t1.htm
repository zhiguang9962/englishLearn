&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A man went to an insurance office to have his life insured. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The manager of the office asked him how old his parents were when they died. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Mother had a bad heart and died at the age of thirty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Father died of tuberculosis when he was thirty-five." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I am very sorry," said the manager, "we cannot insure your life as your parents were not healthy." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As the man was leaving the office, depressed, he met a clerk who had overheard the conversation. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You must not be so frank and tell the truth," said the clerk, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "no office will insure you if you speak like that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Use your imagination a little." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The man went to another office and was shown into the manager's room. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, young man, how old were your parents when they died?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Mother was ninety-three, and she died from a fall off her bicycle. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Father was ninety-eight and he died while he was playing football." </T> <BR>
