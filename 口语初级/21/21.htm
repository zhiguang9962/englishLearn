      <strong>&nbsp; The Phone Rang Again</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Moore had worked hard all day at the office, and  
      she was looking forward to a relaxing evening at home.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she walked in the door, the telephone began to  
      ring. She dashed to answer the phone and found that the caller was a man  
      trying to sell her some light bulbs. She refused and hung up the phone.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smelled dinner cooking and went in to see how her  
      children were getting along with the meal. Everything was ready except  
      setting the table, so Mrs Moore went upstairs to change clothes.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she reached the head of the stairs, the  
      telephone rang again. When Mrs Moore answered it, she found out that her  
      husband wouldn't be home for dinner.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she changed clothes , she went back downstairs to  
      eat. During dinner, the phone rang twice. Her sister called to ask about  
      the familyzs, and a group wanted her to do some volunteer work. She and  
      the children finished dinner and began cleaning up the kitchen. The phone  
      rang again. The neighbours wanted to borrow the garden hose.°.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the kitchen was cleaned . Mrs Moore sat down with  
      a sigh to read while the children did their homework. The phone rang  
      again.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without even answering it, Mrs Moore called to her  
      children, &quot;Get ready, we're all going to a movie. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Great! But why?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It seems that's the only way we can get away from  
      this telephone. &quot;<br>

      Questions on Text B</strong></font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">7. Read the following passage once. Underline the key words while  
      reading and retell the story to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy's motorcycle shone in the afternoon sun and  
      caught Billy's reflection in the fender. He had worked all summer to save  
      enough money for this ?bike and it was his -all his. He strapped on his  
      helmet, slid the new black leather gloves over his hands, then threw one  
      leg over the vinyl seat. There was a roar of the engine as he kicked it  
      into motion, and suddenly there he was, speeding down the street on his  
      motorcycle.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy's little brother, Tommy, watched solemnly from  
      the front door. Tommy was only eight years old, but eight was old enough,  
      he thought, for someone to have his very own motorcycle. It didn't seem  
      fair that Billy had a bike and Tommy didn't. So Tommy sat on the front  
      porch, ate his candy bar, and brooded over the matter as he watched Billy  
      slide around the corner. All he wanted was just one ride.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Billy discovered his bike missing the next  
      morning, there was a widespread investigation by the police, his parents,  
      and the neighbours. No one had seen the bike since the day before. As  
      Billy walked off down the sidewalk, heading for the schoo( bus, his  
      attention was attracted by something black glaring at him from under a  
      hedge. He approached slowly, then suddenly broke into a run. There under  
      the hedge was his motorcycle with one badly dented fender.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached for the handlebars to pull it from under the  
      bushes. When he retracted his hand, there was a familiar sticky substance  
      on his fingers. Tasting the brown sweetness, Billy smiled secretly to  
      himself. He knew he had discovered who had taken his motorcycle for a  
      spin.</font></p>
