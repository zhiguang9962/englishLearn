<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Billy's motorcycle shone in the afternoon sun and caught Billy's reflection in the fender. He had worked all summer to save enough money for this bike and it was his ¡ª all his. He strapped on his helmet, slid the new black leather gloves over his hands, then threw one leg over the vinyl seat. There was a roar of the engine as he kicked it into motion, and suddenly there he was, speeding down the street on his motorcycle.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Billy's little brother, Tommy, watched solemnly from the front door. Tommy was only eight years old, but eight was old enough, he thought, for someone to have his very own motorcycle. It didn't seem fair that Billy had a bike and Tommy didn't. So Tommy sat on the front porch, ate his candy bar, and brooded over the matter as he watched Billy slide around the corner. All he wanted was just one ride.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;   When Billy discovered his bike missing the next morning, there was a widespread investigation by the police, his parents, and the neighbours. No one had seen the bike since the day before. As Billy walked off down the sidewalk, heading for the school bus, his attention was attracted by something black glaring at him from under a hedge. He approached slowly, then suddenly broke into a run. There under the hedge was his motorcycle with one badly dented fender.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;   He reached for the handlebars to pull it from under the bushes. When he retracted his hand, there was a familiar sticky substance on his fingers. Tasting the brown sweetness, Billy smiled secretly to himself. He knew he had discovered who had taken his motorcycle for a spin.
