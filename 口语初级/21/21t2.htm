&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Moore had worked hard all day at the office, and she was looking forward to a relaxing evening at home. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Just as she walked in the door, the telephone began to ring. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She dashed to answer the phone and found that the caller was a man trying to sell her some light bulbs. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She refused and hung up the phone. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She smelled dinner cooking and went in to see how her children were getting along with the meal. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everything was ready except setting the table, so Mrs. Moore went upstairs to change clothes. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Just as she reached the head of the stairs, the telephone rang again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When Mrs. Moore answered it, she found out that her husband wouldn't be home for dinner. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After she changed clothes, she went back downstairs to eat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> During dinner, the phone rang twice. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her sister called to ask about the family, and a group wanted her to do some volunteer work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She and the children finished dinner and began cleaning up the kitchen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The phone rang again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The neighbours wanted to borrow the garden hose. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After the kitchen was cleaned, Mrs. Moore sat down with a sigh to read while the children did their homework. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The phone rang again. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Without even answering it, Mrs. Moore called to her children, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Get ready, we're all going to a movie." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Great! But why?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "It seems that's the only way we can get away from this telephone." </T> <BR>
