&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A poor farmer who had always lived in the country and had never visited a big town won a lot of money, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> so he decided that he could now afford a holiday in an excellent hotel by the sea. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When lunch-time came on his first day there, he decided to go and eat in the restaurant of the hotel. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The head waiter showed him to his table, took his order and went away. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When he looked at the farmer again, he had a surprise! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The farmer had tied his table napkin round his neck. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The head waiter was very annoyed at this and immediately told one of the other waiters in the restaurant to go to the man and inform him, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> without being in any way insulting, that people did not do such a thing in restaurants of that quality. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The waiter went to the farmer and said in a friendly voice, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Good morning, sir. Would you like a shave, or a haircut?" </T> <BR>
