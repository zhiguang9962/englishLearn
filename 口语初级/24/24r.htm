<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to be certain of seeing a play in London, you have to book your seat in advance. You can buy your tickets either at a Theatre Ticket Agency or at the Box Office in the theatre itself. It is very rarely that you will be lucky enough to get a ticket five minutes before the play begins. If you go in a large party it is not always possible for all of you to sit in the same part of the theatre. Some will have to sit in the Stalls, others in the Dress Circle and some in the Upper Circle. These seats are the least expensive of the three. Seats in a Box or the Front Stalls are the most expensive.
