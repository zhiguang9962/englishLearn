&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Sam waited patiently in the long line at the grocery store. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had come to pick up a few items for his mother. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He often did chores for his parents after school. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He enjoyed helping out at home. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As he waited, he daydreamed about the new camera he wanted to buy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He wanted to buy it soon because his family was going on a vacation, and he wanted to take pictures of their trip. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was only one problem. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He needed seven more dollars to buy the camera. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His lawn-mowing job at the Smith's should provide the money shortly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Suddenly Sam was roughly shoved aside. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He recognized Mrs. Sanders, an unkind and unfriendly person who lived on his block. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She had shoved in front of him without even smiling. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just as Mrs. Sanders received her change and her purchases, a ten-dollar bill flew out of her hand and fell at Sam's feet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Sanders, however, was too busy criticizing the cashier for his slowness to notice. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As Sam bent to pick up the money, he thought quickly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The money did belong to Mrs. Sanders, but she deserved to lose it after the way she had behaved, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and, with it, he could buy the camera. </T> <BR>
