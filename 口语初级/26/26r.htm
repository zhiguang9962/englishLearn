<BR> A: They don't really think you took it, do they?
<BR> B: I don't know. I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life.
<BR> A: How many of them were there?
<BR> B: Three ¡ª but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions.
<BR> A: Like what?
<BR> B: Oh, he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I had a bath or a shower ¡ª you know, things like that.
<BR> A: What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing? 
<BR> B: I've no idea. Oh yes, and the most ridiculous thing. He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning.
<BR> A: Oh well, that's it. They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat. I should think you'll get thirty years.
<BR> B: Hmm. Thank you very much.
