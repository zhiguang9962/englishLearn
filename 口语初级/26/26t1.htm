&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. and Mrs. Williams had always spent their summer holidays in England in the past, in a small boarding-house at the seaside. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One year, however, Mr. Williams made a lot of money in his business, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> so they decided to go to Rome and stay at a really good hotel while they went around and saw the sights of that famous city. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They flew to Rome, and arrived at their hotel late one evening. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They expected that they would have to go to bed hungry, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> because in the boarding-houses they had been used to in the past, no meals were served after seven o'clock in the evening. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were therefore surprised when the clerk who received them in the hall of the hotel asked them whether they would be taking dinner there that night. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Are you still serving dinner then?" asked Mrs. Williams. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yes, certainly, madam," answered the clerk. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We serve it until half-past nine." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "What are the times of meals then?" asked Mr. Williams. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, sir," answered the clerk, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "we serve breakfast from seven to half-past eleven in the morning, lunch from twelve to three in the afternoon, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> tea from four to five, and dinner from six to half-past nine." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the sights of Rome!" said Mrs. Williams in a disappointed voice. </T> <BR>
