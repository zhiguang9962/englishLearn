&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Lise, Nick and Bill had gone out walking for the day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Nick got back about six. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Haven't Bill and Lise arrived yet?" he asked. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I thought they were ahead of me ..." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It was 7:30 when Bill and Lise came in. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The others were just finishing supper. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Where on earth have you been?" Nick asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "We'll tell you all about it after supper," Bill said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We'd better go and get our food. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The warden's already told us that we're late ..." </T>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After supper, the group sat around talking. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> STEVE: Ugh! The food here really is bad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My soup was cold. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And the meat ¡ª huh! ¡ª it was like leather! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: Yes, and they don't give you very much, either. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm still hungry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Are hostels in England always as bad as this? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ANNA: I haven't stayed in one for ages. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I'm sure this one is especially bad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And the warden is so unpleasant ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: "Don't do this, don't do that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You mustn't do this, you can't do that ..." </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> STEVE: Well, I'm going to write a letter of complaint. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> To the Secretary of the Youth Hostels Association! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: And we'll all help you ... </T> <BR>
