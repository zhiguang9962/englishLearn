      The Shopping List<br> 
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Black was having a lot of trouble with her  
      skin, so she went to her doctor about it. He could not find anything wrong  
      th her, however, so he sent her to the local hospital for tests. The  
      hospital, of course, sent the results of the tests direct to Mrs Black's  
      doctor, and the next morning he telephoned her to give her a list of the  
      things that he thought she should not eat, any of thern might be the cause  
      of her skin trouble.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Black carefully wrote all the things down on a  
      piece of paper, which she then left beside the telephone while she went  
      out to a ladies' meeting.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she got back home two hours later, she found her  
      husband waiting for her. He had a big basket full of packages beside him,  
      and when he saw her, he said, &quot;Hullo, dear. I have done all your  
      shopping for you.&quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Done all my shopping?&quot; she asked in  
      surprise. &quot;But how you know what I wanted?&quot;<br> 
      &quot;Well, When I got home, I found your shopping list beside telephone ,  
      &quot; answered her husband , &quot;so I went down to the shops and bought  
      everything you had written down. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course , Mrs Black had to tell him that he had  
      bought all<br> 
      the things the doctor did not allow her to eat!</font></p>

      <strong>&nbsp; A Language Mix-Up</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two young British tourists were travelling in France  
      when a policeman stopped their car and gave it a search. He found a bag of  
      whit.e powder which looked suspicious. &quot;Drogue?&quot; asked the  
      heroin-conscious policeman. &quot;Yes, dogs,&quot; they responded, and  
      promptly found themselves in jail.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;Analysis of the powder revealed that it  
      was a chemical which gives off a smell , used to discourage dogs from  
      using the sides of the car as a toilet. The tourists were set free, after  
      promising to take a few French lessons before<br> 
      their next vacation in France.<br>
