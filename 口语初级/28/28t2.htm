&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Bill Davidson is throwing some paper on the floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Miss Mead, his teacher, is looking at the paper. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MISS MEAD: Don't throw paper on the floor, Bill. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: Where shall I put it, miss? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MISS MEAD: Put it in the waste-paper basket, please. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: But Peter and Tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now it's full. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MISS MEAD: In that case, take the basket outside and empty it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: Yes, miss. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (He takes the basket out of the room and returns with it a few moments later.) <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MISS MEAD: Where did you empty the basket, Bill? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: In the playground, miss. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MISS MEAD: Silly boy! The dustbin is at the back of the school. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now pick up the paper and put it in the dustbin. </T> <BR>
