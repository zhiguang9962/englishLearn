      <strong>&nbsp; Some Sausage Sandwiches</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning last summer Mrs Andrews made some sausage  
      sandwiches for her husband's lunch. There was one sausage left over. Mrs  
      Andrews didn't care for sausages herself and so she gave the last one to  
      Henry, their little dog. Henry ate it up q uickly.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the morning the dog got ill. He wouldn't stop  
      shaking his head and he couldn't stand up properly. Mrs Andrews thought,  
      &quot;He has eaten something that didn't agree with him. Maybe that  
      sausage was bad. . . &quot; She suddenly remembered her huusband's lunch.  
      She ran to the telephone and called Jim at the office.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Jim, I hope you haven't eaten any of those  
      sandwiches yet. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, I have. . . &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You have? Well, listen- don't eat any more. I  
      gave Henry the last sausage and now he's ill. Go to the doctor, Jim. Tell  
      the doctor about the dog. Get some medicine at once. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim came home at lunchtime and went to bed. &quot;I had  
      a very wnpleasant hour with the doctor,&quot; he told his wife. &quot;The  
      medicine made me very sick.&quot; The next morning Jim was fine. Henry  
      seemed quite well again too. At eleven o'clock the milkman came with the  
      milk.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Good morning, Mrs Andrews,&quot; The milkman  
      said. &quot;How's your dog this morning? I have been thinking about him. .  
      . &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have you?' Well, he seems alright now, but. . .  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yesterday morning he and I had a little accident.  
      He jumped up at .me and I dropped a bottle of milk on his head. &quot;</font></p>
