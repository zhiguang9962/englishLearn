<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; The ladies' club always had a meeting every Friday afternoon and someone came to talk to them about important things. After that, they had tea and asked questions.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; One Friday, a gentleman came and talked to the club about food. "There is not enough food in the world for everybody," he said. "More than half the people in the world are hungry. And when they get more food, they have more babies, so they never stop being hungry. Somewhere in the world, a woman is having a baby every minute, day and night. What are we going to do about it?" He waited for a few seconds before he continued, but before he began to speak again, one of the ladies said, "Well, why don't we find that woman and stop her?"
