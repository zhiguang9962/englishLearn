<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: Which of the two do you think is better? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean, what's the difference between them? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Well ... this one costs more, but it has a much better sound. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This part of it is made of wood, not plastic. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And there's a tone control, too. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: I only want it for the kitchen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I like to listen to the news at breakfast time. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Hmm ... well, the other one is good for the money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's much cheaper. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We sell a lot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one, please. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Can I pay by cheque? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Certainly. </T> <BR>
