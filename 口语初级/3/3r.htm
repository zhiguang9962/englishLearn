<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;  The police in the big city were looking for a thief. At last they caught him. But while they were taking photographs of him ¡ª from the front, from the left, from the right, with a hat, without a hat ¡ª he suddenly attacked the policemen and ran off. They tried to catch him, but he got away.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Then a week later the telephone rang in the police-station, and somebody said, "You are looking for Bill Cross, aren't you?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, he left here for Waterbridge an hour ago."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Waterbridge was a small town about 100 miles from the city. The city police at once sent four different photographs of the thief to the police in Waterbridge.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Less than twelve hours later they got a telephone call from the police in Waterbridge. "We have caught the fourth this evening, we think."
