&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It was Jimmy's birthday, and he was five years old. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He got quite a lot of nice birthday presents from his family, and one of them was a beautiful big drum. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Who gave him that thing?" Jimmy's father said when he saw it. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "His grandfather did," answered Jimmy's mother. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh," said his father. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of course, Jimmy liked his drum very much. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He made a terrible noise with it, but his mother did not mind. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His father was working during the day, and Jimmy was in bed when he got home in the evening, so he did not hear the noise. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But one of the neighbours did not like the noise at all, so one morning a few days later, she took a sharp knife and went to Jimmy's house while he was hitting his drum. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She said to him, "Hullo, Jimmy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you know, there's something very nice inside your drum. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here's a knife. Open the drum and let's find it." </T> <BR>
