      <strong>The Bloody Thumb</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met the old man at a cafe. I was a stranger in the  
      town.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did you hear the radio news yesterday?&quot; he  
      asked me.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I didn't,&quot; I said.&quot;Was there anything  
      exciting?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Exciting, no! It was important to me-and very,  
      very sad.pack of hungry dogs killed and ate my best friend. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh dear ! &quot; I cried. &quot;I am sorry. How  
      did it happen?&quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He was working in his olive grove on the  
      hilisides. The pack attacked him there. we'll never know all the facts ,  
      of curse. When he didn't return, I went to the grove and-&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You found the body?&quot; I asked.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old fellow drank half his coffee. &quot;The  
      body?&quot; he repeated.&quot;No, no. .I said they were hungry dogs,  
      didn't I? The g bones were lying here and there in the grove. But I found  
      this-&quot; He pushed open a matchbox which he was holding in his</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box contained a man's thumb. It was lying on some  
      hite, bloody material. There was a cut-an old cut-on the mmb nail.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;See that cut,&quot; the man said. &quot;I  
      recognised it. This is my fiend's right thumb. The dogs ate the rest of  
      him! &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man began to cry then. He finished his coffee  
      quick. ly and left the cafe. I drank mine and called the waiter.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll pay the gentleman's bill,&quot; I said.  
      &quot;Please don't trou. ble him with it. His poor friend-how awful!  
      You've heard the news?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waiter laughed . &quot;Yes. There's a hole in the  
      bottom of the matchbox. He puts his own thumb through the hole. The  
      'blood' is red ink, I believe. Is the story worth a cup of coffee,  
      sir?&quot;</font></p>

      There Are Some Things You Can't Get Away Without</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a confession to make, and the sooner it gets out  
      in the open, the better I'll feel about. I don't drive a car.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans are broad-minded people. they'll accept the  
      fact that a person newspapercan be an alcoholic, a dope fiend, a wife  
      beater, and even anewspaperman but if a man doesn't drive. therc is  
      something wrong with him.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the years I've found it very embarrassing to  
      admit it to anyand my best friends tend to view me with suspicion and  
      contempt.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where I really run into. trouble is when I go into  
      a stone and try to made a purchase with a check.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happend again last week when I went to a discount  
      house at a large shopping center in maryland.Iwanted to buy a portable  
      tyewriter,and the salesman was very helpful about showing me the different 
      modeIs.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided on one, and then I said, &quot;May I write  
      out a personal check?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Naturally, &quot; he said kindly. &quot;Do you  
      have any identification?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Of course,&quot; I said. I produced an American  
      Express credit card, a Diner's Club credit card, a Bell Telephone credit  
      card d i pass to the White House.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man inspected them all and then said,&quot;Where's  
      your driver's license?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't. have one,&quot; I replied..<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did you lose it?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, I didn't lose it. I don't drive a car. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed a button under the cash register, and  
      suddenly a floor manager came rushing over.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The salesman had now become surly.&quot;Thes guy's  
      trying to cash a checd, and he doesn't have a driver's license. Should I  
      call the store detective?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wait a minute. I'll talk to him , &quot; the  
      manager said. &quot;Did you lose your driver's license for some traffic  
      offense?&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, I've never driven. I don't like to drive.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nobody likes to drive,&quot; the floor manager  
      shouted. &quot;That's no excuse. Why are you trying&nbsp; to cash a check  
      if you don't have a driver's license?&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thought all the other identification was good  
      enough,&quot; I explained. By this time the president of the store had  
      arrived on the scene. Fortu nately, he recognized my name and okayed the  
      check. He was very embarrassed by the treatment I had received and said,  
      come on, I'll buy you a drink. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I forgot to tell you,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't drink  
      either. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; This was too much, even for him, and he pushed me toward the  
      door.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Get out of here , &quot; he said , &quot;and don't come  
      back ! &quot;<br>
