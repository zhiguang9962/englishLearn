&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I met the old man at a caf¨¦. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was a stranger in the town. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Did you hear the radio news yesterday?" he asked me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I didn't," I said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Was there anything exciting?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Exciting, no! It was important to me ¡ª and very, very sad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A pack of hungry dogs killed and ate my best friend." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh dear!" I cried. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I am sorry. How did it happen?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "He was working in his olive grove on the hillside. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The pack attacked him there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We'll never know all the facts, of course. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When he didn't return, I went to the grove and ¡ª" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You found the body?" I asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The old fellow drank half his coffee. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The body?" he repeated. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "No, no. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I said they were hungry dogs, didn't I? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The big bones were lying here and there in the grove. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I found this ¡ª" </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He pushed open a matchbox which he was holding in his hand. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The box contained a man's thumb. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was lying on some white, bloody material. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was a cut ¡ª an old cut ¡ª on the thumb nail. </T>
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "See that cut," the man said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I recognised it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is my friend's right thumb. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The dogs ate the rest of him!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The old man began to cry then. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He finished his coffee quickly and left the caf¨¦. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I drank mine and called the waiter. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I'll pay the gentleman's bill," I said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Please don't trouble him with it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His poor friend ¡ª how awful! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You've heard the news?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The waiter laughed, "Yes. There's a hole in the bottom of the matchbox. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He puts his own thumb through the hole. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The¡®blood' is red ink, I believe. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Is the story worth a cup of coffee, sir?" </T> <BR>
