&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dolores works in a shop selling gramophone records. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One afternoon a middle-aged woman came in, sat on a stool in front of the counter, and smiled at her brightly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I want a record, dear," she began. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "One I heard on the radio this morning." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "What was the record called?" Dolores asked, without much hope. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The woman shook her head. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I don't remember. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I should know it if I heard it, though. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps if you play me a few records, I shall be able to pick it out." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She settled herself more comfortably on her stool. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "We have hundreds of records in stock," Dolores pointed out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "It would take a very long time to play you even a little of each. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Could you hum it to me?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The woman shook her head again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I can't even sing the National Anthem in tune. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We should only get into a complete muddle if I were to start humming." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She looked quite depressed, as if this reminder of her own lack of musical ability were the last straw. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then suddenly her face brightened. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I've just remembered something," she said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "It comes from a play. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There's a girl who speaks very badly, if you see what I mean. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But after a time she learns to talk well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Something about ¡ª what do you call it? Phonetics." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This was enough for Dolores. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "If you ask me, it's from 'My Fair Lady', " she said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "That's it, dear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you'd thought of it sooner, we wouldn't have wasted so much time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suppose you are new to the job." </T> <BR>
