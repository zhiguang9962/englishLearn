&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Once there was no money. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If people wanted to get something, they had to give something. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is the way it used to be. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I will give you my cow for your pig," a man would say. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I'll give you my bowl if you give me a shirt," another would say. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Here are seven oranges for one fish." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Will you give me a chicken for a bag of corn?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> People had to trade things every day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had to give a thing to get a thing because there wasn't any money. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But they had to work out a good trade, one that came out even. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What could you get for two chickens? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Were three bags of apples a good trade for two bags of grapes? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Or one bag of apples for a little butter? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What was an even trade? It was hard to know. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And it was too hard to carry around all the things for trading. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People had to use too much time getting things they needed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So they thought of a new way to trade. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They thought of money. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Money could "stand for" apples, or bowls, or pigs. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And a pocketful of money was better than a pocketful of pigs. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> With money, it was not so hard to trade. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everyone could use money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The man who needed a pig could buy it with money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The man who sold the pig could keep the money until he needed something. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People could work for money, and people buy things with the money they got from work. </T> <BR>
