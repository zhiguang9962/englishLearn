<P align=center><B>A Bad Student</B></P> <BR>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Peter's father wants to know how his son is getting along in school. One day he asks him: 
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Peter, how are you getting along in school? What seat do you have in the class? Does the teacher place you in seats according to your marks?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Yes, father."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "And what seat do you have?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Number twenty-one."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "And how many students are there in your class?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Twenty-one, father."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Several weeks pass. Peter, who is a bad student and studies very little, brings home the marks of his monthly examinations.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "How are you getting along in school now, Peter?" asks his father. "Your marks do not seem to be very good."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I am getting along much better now, father."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "What is your place in the class now?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Number twenty now."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Good. Then you are one place ahead."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "No, father. One of the students left the class. His family moved to another town."
