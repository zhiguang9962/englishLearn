<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a dark day when we got our report cards. The sky was full of gray clouds and it was sprinkling rain. I was over to Clyde's house and Gloria and Kitty were there. Sam probably would have been there, too, only he had got a two-week job in the afternoons helping out at Freddie's. Actually he only did it so that his mother would let him be on the track team again. Sam and his mother had this little system going. He would do something good-doing and she'd let him do something that he wanted to.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     Clyde's report card was on the kitchen table and we all sat around it like it was some kind of a big important document. I had got a pretty good report card and had wanted to show it off but I knew it wasn't the time. Clyde pushed the card toward me and I read it. He had all satisfactory remarks on the side labeled Personal Traits and Behavior. He had also received B's in music and art appreciation. But everything else was either a C or a D except mathematics. His mathematics mark was a big red F that had been circled. I don't know why they had to circle the F when it was the only red mark on the card. In the Teacher's Comments section someone had written that Clyde had "little ability to handle an academic program."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "A little ability is better than none," I said. No one said anything so I figured it probably wasn't the right time to try to cheer Clyde up. 
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    I knew all about his switching from a commercial program to an academic program, but I really hadn't thought he'd have any trouble. 
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I saw the grade adviser today. He said I should switch back to the commercial program." Clyde looked like he'd start crying any minute. His eyes were red and his voice was shaky. "He said that I had to take mathematics over and if I failed again or failed another required subject I couldn't graduate. The way it is now I'm going to have to finish up in the summer because I switched over."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I think you can pass it if you really want to," Kitty said. Clyde's sister was so pretty I couldn't even look at her. If I did, I started feeling funny and couldn't talk right. Sometimes I daydreamed about marrying her. 
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Just then Clyde's mother came in and he gave a quick look at Kitty.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Hi, young ladies and young gentlemen." Mrs. Jones was a kind of heavy woman but she was pretty, too. You could tell she was Kitty's mother if you looked close. She put her package down and started taking things out. "I heard you people talking when I first came in. By the way you hushed up I guess you don't want me to hear what you were talking about. I'll be out of your way in a minute, soon as I put the frozen foods in the refrigerator."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I got my report card today," Clyde said. His mother stopped taking the food out and turned toward us. Clyde pushed the report card about two inches toward her. She really didn't even have to look at the card to know that it was bad. She could have told that just by looking at Clyde. But she picked it up and looked at it a long time. First she looked at one side and then the other and then back at the first side again.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "What did they say around the school?" she asked, still looking at the card.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "They said I should drop the academic course and go back to the other one." I could hardly hear Clyde, he spoke so low.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Well, what are you going to do, young man?" She looked up at Clyde and Clyde looked up at her and there were tears in his eyes and I almost started crying. I can't stand to see my friends cry. "What are you going to do, Mr. Jones?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I'm ¡ª I'm going to keep the academic course," Clyde said. 
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "You think it's going to be any easier this time?" Mrs. Jones asked.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "No."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Things ain't always easy. Lord knows that things ain't always easy." For a minute there was a faraway look in her eyes, but then her face turned into a big smile. "You're just like your father, boy. That man never would give up on anything he really wanted. Did I ever tell you the time he was trying to learn to play the trombone?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "No." Clyde still had tears in his eyes but he was smiling, too. Suddenly everybody was happy. It was like seeing a rainbow when it was still raining.
