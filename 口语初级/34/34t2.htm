&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Tom Jackson and Charles Brown are talking about their summer holidays. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TOM: Where are you going for your holidays, Charles? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: To Australia. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TOM: Good gracious! You certainly are lucky. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How are you going there? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: By air, of course. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It takes over two weeks to go by sea. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TOM: I once went to Singapore by air. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was very exciting ¡ª but never again. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: Why? Did you feel frightened? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TOM: For a short time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of the engines caught fire. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: What did the pilot do? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TOM: He put it out and flew back to the airport. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: Did you land safely? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TOM: Yes, we did. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I shall never fly again. </T> <BR>
