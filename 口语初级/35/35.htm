      A Proud Linguist<br> 
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time there was an Austrian emperor  
      who made it a rule to interview every one of his soldiers once a year.  
      During the interviews he invariably asked three questions- &quot;How old  
      are'you?&quot;, &quot;How long have you been in my army?&quot; and  
      &quot;Are you satisfied with your pay and the food you get?&quot; -in that  
      order.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One year, the day before the imperial interviews, a  
      Frenchman got himself enlisted in the Austrian army. Since he knew no  
      German he was on tenterhooks. Now there was an old soldier in his unit who  
      knew a little French and was anxious to help. In fact he knew just about  
      enough French to be able to teach his young friend the shortest possible  
      answers, in the proper order , to the imperial questions.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day arrived with all the sound and colour that  
      befitted it. The Emperor in all his splendour was seated on the throne,  
      his entourage attending respectfully in. the background. The soldiers  
      filed past him, each taking barely half a minute during which time the  
      questions were asked and the answers reverently provided.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Frenchman's turn came, far from being nerous  
      he was sure of himself, havi.ng recited the answers, in the proper order,  
      he did not know how many times. The Emperor looked at him long and hard  
      and suddenly took it into his head that he had seen the young man  
      somewhere before. He began, a little out of the usual order, with the  
      second question;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How long have you been in my army ?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Twenty-one years , &quot; replied the Frenchman ,  
      not without some pride in his ability to learn a foreign language so  
      quickly and so well.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monarch was surprised, for the young man did not  
      look very much older than that , but he went on to ask:<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then how old are you?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One day,&quot; came the answer.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was too much for the Emperor, who sat back and  
      muttered .<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well , well. That beats me. It seems either  
      you're mad or I am. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Positive that that was the last of the imperial  
      questions, the proud linguist stepped forward and with a smile said:<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Both, your majesty. &quot;<br>

      Adventure at Midnight<br> 
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long ago there 1 ived two brothers who were  
      very poor. They lived in tiny huts at opposite sides of their large wheat  
      field. At the end of each summer, when harvest time came, the brothers  
      divided the grain they had grown into two equal parts. Some of it they  
      took to be milled into flour, from which they baked bread. The rest was  
      sold for money, with which they bought shoes, clothing, and tools.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they toiled from sunup to sundown, six days a  
      week, they hardly had enough to eat. In spite of this, they were happy  
      because of their great love for one another.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one year, Sirnon, the younger brother. felt a great  
      sadness.<br> 
      His wife said, &quot;Tell me what is making you so blue? You no longer  
      sing while you work, and the twinkle is gone from your eye. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are right , dear wife. I am worried about my  
      older brother , Ruben. He is alone in the world, with neither wife nor  
      children. Who will care for him when he gets old and can no longer work?  
      If only he had some money to save for his old age! It isn't fair that we  
      share the harvest equally. But he is proud and will not accept gifts from  
      me. What shall I do?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Would you take food from your own children?  
      &quot; She asked in astonishment. &quot;There is nothing you can do,  
      &quot;'she said. &quot;So forget it. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simon knew that his wife was right , but he was  
      determined to help Ruben, come what might.<br> 
      Meanwhile, Ruben was sitting under a tree, thinking deeply. When he  
      noticed a bird on the way to its winter home, he said, that bird and I are  
      fortunate because we are free. Neither of us has a wife and children  
      always needing to be fed. But my poor brother, Simon, is burdened with a 
      family.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Itisn't fair that we share the harvest equally.  
      Surely he deserves more than I! But he is very proud and will not accept  
      gifts from me. What can I do? In several days we'll take our harvest to  
      town. If I don't think of a plan soon, it will be too late. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night. when the moon was high in the sky, Ruben  
      went quietly to his barn where he filled a sack with wheat'?and put in on  
      his shoulder. Then he crossed the empty field to his brother's hut and  
      secretly placed his wheat with Simon's.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah.&quot; he said when he had finished,  
      &quot;this is better. Now my dear younger brother will have more than I.  
      &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruben went happily back to his hut and slept soundly  
      for the first time in wceks.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour later, Simon woke up with a start. He had  
      dreamed of a marvelous plan. He crept out of bed, got dressed, and went to  
      his barn. Filling a sack with wheat., walking across the field to Ruben's  
      hut, and placing it there took very little time. Before long, he was back  
      in bed, pulling up the covers.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now I can sleep peacefully,&quot; he thought,  
      &quot;because Ruben will have a little extra to save for his old age.  
      &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning Ruhen and Simon were amazed. How could  
      this be? 'hheir piles were equal, yet each knew he had secretly given  
      wheat to his brother. Something must have gone wrong.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that night Ruben waited until midnight, when he  
      again took Simon some of his grain. &quot;There! Now I am fully awake and  
      I'm sure I put it on his pile. Tomorrow mine will be smaller and his  
      larger, as it should be. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time later, Simon did the same. He, too, was  
      sure that all would be well this time.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when day dawned, each brother saw that his share  
      was exactly half the harvest. Ruben and Simon were desperate. Tomorrow  
      they were to go to town to sell their grain. Tonight was their last  
      chance.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Midnight came again. But this time Ruben and Simon  
      chose the same moment to carry out their mission of brotherly love. Each  
      placed a sack of wheat on his shoulders and began to walk across the  
      field. Halfway across they met.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ruben! What are you doing out so late at  
      night?&quot; cried Simon in dismay. He tried to hide his sack.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled, Ruben dropped his bundle. Then he saw Simon's  
      sack and they both began to laugh. When they finished laughing, they  
      hugged each other tightly. Their hearts were full of love for each other  
      and they were content.<br>
