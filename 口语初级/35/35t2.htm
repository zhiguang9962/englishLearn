&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Davidson is standing outside his house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He has forgotten to bring his key with him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Henry Black and John Field walk past and they say "Hello" to Mr. Davidson. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAVIDSON: Hello, boys. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Can you help me? I've forgotten my key and I can't get in. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN AND HENRY: We'll try our best, Mr. Davidson. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAVIDSON: You're both taller than me, aren't you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: Yes, I'm over five foot ten. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm the tallest of the three of us. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: But I'm almost as tall as John. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAVIDSON: Can you climb on John's shoulders and reach that window? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: All right. </T> (He climbs on John's shoulders.) 
<T TYPE=SEN> What shall I do now? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAVIDSON: Open the window, please, and climb through it into the house. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: Oh dear, I can't move it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's fastened inside. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAVIDSON: Can you break the window? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: Look! There's a policeman! He's coming towards us. </T> <BR>
