      Three Wishes</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time , there lived a woodman and his wife.  
      They were very poor, and they lived in a cottage on the edge of a forest.  
      Every day, the woodman would set out early in the, morning to chop down  
      trees. .</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the woodman was travelling through the forest one  
      day, he saw a fine old oak tree. &quot;That will make plenty of  
      planks,&quot; he thought, as he felt the blade of his axe to make sure it  
      was sharp. He was about to strike the tree with the axe , when he heard  
      someone crying out: &quot;Please don't hurt this tree. &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woodman looked around him and saw a tiny fairy.  
      &quot;If you do not hurt this tree , &quot; she said , &quot;I will grant  
      you and yotar wife three wishes. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I won't hurt the tree,&quot; said the woodman  
      kindly. Then the fairy vanished !<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, the woodman walked slowly home. He was  
      feeling very hungry and could not wait for his supper.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Is my supper ready?&quot; the woodman asked his  
      wife.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not for at least two hours, replied his wife. So  
      the woodman sat in a chair by the fire.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I wish I had a big black sausage to eat right  
      now,&quot; he said<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out loud. And suddenly, a delicious sausage appeared on  
      the table before himt &quot;Why has that black sausage suddenly  
      appeared?&quot; the woodman's wife asked.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the woodman told his wife the story about the fairy.  
      But his wife was very angry. &quot;You have wasted the first of our  
      wishes,&quot; she said crossly. &quot;I wish that sausage were on your  
      nose !&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that, the sausage jumped up and stuck fast on  
      the woodman's nose. His wife could not pull it off and nor could he, so  
      the only thing to do was to w.ish it on the table again, which the woodman  
      did.<br> 
      What a waste of three wishes! The only thing the woodman had was a good  
      supper of black sausage.</font></p>

      reading and retell the story to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know why birds sit on telephone lines. They  
      listen.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am either nine or ten years old. At the orphanage  
      they call me Miguel.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I want to feel improtant, I say, &quot;Call me Don  
      Miguel. &quot; I used to act important all the time because 1 felt I  
      wasn't.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then, no one liked me very much because I didn't  
      like other peo<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But last year, I began to learn two important things: I  
      was learning to see, not just look. And I was learning to listen, not just  
      hear.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to lie in the dark and make up relatives that I  
      didn't have. My favorite relative was a nice old man who spoke Spanish,  
      like me.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day a man came to see me. He said he was my uncle.  
      &quot;I don't have an uncle,&quot; I said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now you do , &quot; he said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was an old man who liked children. He had a boy once  
      who went to Korea. His daughter moved to the City. He said the City can be  
      a difficult place in which to live. He taught me how to see and listen. I  
      don't know if he is my uncle or not; neither did he, but he came to see me  
      often. I guess if you act like an uncle all the time, you are one.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not a good student before my uncle came along. He  
      took me walking in the fields. At one point he spread his arms and said.  
      &quot;It is all here. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What?&quot; I said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everything you need to know,&quot; he replied.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first it appeared to be nothing more than just a few  
      trees. I thought I was nowhere. Then he had me close n-.y eyes. First I  
      heard the breeze in the grass, then in the trees. I also heard a faraway  
      train and a barking dog. For a while I heard nothing. I was almost scared.  
      He said to listen harder.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard my heart beat.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beause I used to be so sad, I had almost forgotten that  
      I had a heart.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I asked him who he was.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;An experiment , &quot; he said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What kind of an experiment?&quot; I said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He grinned and said, &quot;Nobody knows. Like you,  
      there is no one in the world like me. So who is to say what I will be.  
      &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day in the field he showed me the way the breeze  
      made the trees move. The rustling of the leaves made a sound that  
      frightened a nearby bird. It flew away.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched the bird drop an acorn.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The bird , &quot; he said , &quot;cari make a  
      seed move. From that seed the oak can grow fifty feet tall. It will be a  
      friend to those who want one. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always knew that trees were there, but I never knew  
      they were real like me.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Sunday I was angry. When my uncle came , I said :  
      &quot;I don't have anything. I wish I had something. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You have everything worth having,&quot; he said.  
      &quot;And I will give you even more. I will give some secrets of the  
      Universe. Do you believe me?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, wanting to believe him.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave me three small seeds.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Put each seed into a small box filled with dirt.  
      Then care for them. Talk to them if you wish. They will grow with you.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they are in larger boxes. One of t.he plants has  
      grown up to my knee. I sometimes wonder what else it is up to.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time we were walking in the field when we saw  
      two birds on a telephone line. They seemed so peaceful. Then suddenly they  
      flew away. My uncle just laughed.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;See,&quot; he said.&quot;Someone said something  
      they didn't like.&amp; careful what you tell the birds.&quot;<br> 
      One night I passed by the office of the orphanage. A man I don't iike very  
      much was on the phone. He was angry and loud.</font>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he'left, I went into the office and picked up the  
      phone. I heard the funniest sound.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Listen,&quot; I said. &quot;Listen, liirds. Come  
      on back, never mind what he says. We like you. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day-Unele did not come: I waited and waited but he  
      did not come. The man I don't like at the orphanage said Uncle was sick.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;May I go and see him?&quot; I asked.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;He may be contagious.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;May I call him?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, &quot; he said. &quot;I'll call him for you.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't do that,&quot; I said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why not?&quot; .<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You'll make the birds fly away. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sneaked into the office one night and called Uncle.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you all right?&quot; I asked.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, but I must go away. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To make room for something else. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Will you come back?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will help you remember me, if you want me to.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do. . . . Ido. . . .&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went to bed at night, I would try to imagine  
      that he was there. He was harder and harder to see. One night, he was not  
      there at all. There was only a grcen ficld.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went back to our field. It was raining. T'he sky was  
      dark, the way I was inside. I looked for Uricle everywhere. I called his  
      name.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was angry for a while. I said some things out loud  
      that I shouldn't have said. Two birds flew out of the trec.I made them get  
      wet.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, I saw something that was only an inch  
      or two tall. It was where that hird dropped the acorn. I didn't tell  
      anybody, but I knew.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someday Uncle will be fifty feet tall.<br>
