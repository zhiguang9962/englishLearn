&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith is well known in Washington because of his many social blunders. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He always likes to attend the various social functions because he wants to expand his circle of friends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Whenever he is invited, he goes, unless he is ill. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Recently he received an invitation to a fashionable banquet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Although he did not know the hostess, he accepted the invitation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was secretly very pleased, because he felt that his reputation as a desirable guest was growing. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When he arrived at the banquet hall, he found that about one hundred people had been invited. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He began to move around the hall. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He spoke to other guests whether he knew them or not. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He soon realized that he had never met any of the other people present, although they seemed to know each other. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> At dinner, he was seated beside a very dignified woman. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The woman tried to be friendly even though she had never met Mr. Smith before. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She spoke politely, whenever he spoke to her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Between the first and second course of the meal, she turned to Mr. Smith and said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Do you see that gray-haired man at the end of the table? The one with the glasses." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Ah, yes. Who is he?" asked Mr. Smith. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "He's the Secretary of the Interior!" she replied. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith said: "So that's the Secretary of the Interior! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm afraid that I find very little to admire about him, although he is the Secretary." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The woman stiffened and did not reply. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Smith continued in spite of her coldness. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I really can't see how he received his appointment, unless he is perhaps a relative of the President." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "It hardly matters whether you like the Secretary or not," she said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "He was chosen because the President thought he was the man for the job. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If he does the job well, you should have no complaint." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "That's just it," persisted Smith. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "No one does the things he does, unless he is a complete fool!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Sir!" said the woman in all her dignity. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Do you know who I am?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "No," replied Smith. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I am the Secretary's wife," she said coldly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith was flabbergasted, but he went on in spite of his embarrassment. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Madam, do you know who I am?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "No, I don't," the woman replied. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Thank goodness!" exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he quickly left the table. </T> <BR>
