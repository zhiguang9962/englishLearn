&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This was the conversation in the expensive shop in London. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A man and a woman walked in and ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Can I help you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: Yes, we're looking for a watch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's for me. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: I see. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What price are you interested in? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAN: The price doesn't matter. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it must be a gold watch. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: And automatic. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I must have an automatic watch! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Hmm ... something like this, perhaps. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's one of our best watches. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Made in Switzerland. Fully automatic. With a calendar and ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAN: It's nice ... but haven't you got anything better? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Better? Better than this?  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Well, we have some <I>Orly de luxe</I> watches ... probably the best watch in the world. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I'm afraid they're far more expensive than this one. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They cost ...</T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAN: Would you show us one, please? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: Yes, could we see one of them, please? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: They're in the manager's office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You see, we don't ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAN: Could you possibly get one or two of them now? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Er ... yes, of course. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Would you wait here for a moment, please? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (He goes to the manager's office and knocks on the door.) <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: Come in. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: Mr. Crawford, I have two customers who ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> WOMAN: All right! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Hands up! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Stand over there! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SALESMAN: What in the world ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAN: Shut up! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And open that safe! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Come on! Open it! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: I ... I can't open it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAN: What do you mean? You must open it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: You told me to put my hands up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How can I open the safe with my hands up? </T> <BR>
