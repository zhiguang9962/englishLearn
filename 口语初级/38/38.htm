      Lesson 38<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
      Text A<br> 
      <br> 
      <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
      Can't She Type?<br> 
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The well-known banker, T. J. Ellington, was at  
      one time in his younger days the manager of a New York office. His  
      secretary had been with him for many years, and knew his ways and habits.  
      She always kept a glass of water on his desk, and knew that he disliked  
      flowers in the office. He had a habit of interrupting a letter (when she  
      was writing it down) with a few words on other subjects which had no  
      connection with the letter; but she knew how to deal with that. She was  
      never late , and was always willing to work beyond office hours when  
      necessary. Therefore, when she left the office to get married, Ellington  
      felt rather sorry for himself.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those days good secretaries were hard to find.  
      Ellington rang up the office in the city which had supplied him before;  
      but the woman there said that she had no one suitable. He tried several  
      other places, but the answer was always the same. There did not seem to be  
      any secretaries unemployed. But it was absolutely necessary for him to  
      find someone , and at last he rang up the first office again and urged the  
      woman to find a girl who could at least type.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;there's Miss  
      Steele. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Good!&quot; cried Ellington. &quot;Send her along  
      at once. I really<br> 
      must have someone here immediately. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm not sure about her,&quot; said the woman  
      doubtfully. &quot;Why? Can't she type? Is she too old?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh, she's quite young. In fact she's only just  
      left the Secretarial College. She types very well indeed. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, then, what's the matter? Send her here at  
      once. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;All right, if you say so. But she's a bit simple.  
      &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Steele arrived soon afterwards, and he explained  
      her duties to her. At first she refused to accept the post; she said that  
      she had had no experience and was not used to such work. But after a  
      further conversation he managed to persuade her to come, at least for a  
      week or two. She agreed, but her face had a doubtful expression on it as  
      she went out.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the following morning Miss Steele arrived at the  
      office ready for work. Ellington had one letter to which he wished to  
      reply immediately, and he rang the bell. Miss Steele came in quietly and  
      sat down, pencil in hand and notebook on knee. Ellington told her to take  
      a letter, and was glad to see that she could write as fast as he spoke. It  
      was soon done and she went out to type it.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well , &quot; thought Ellington, &quot;there  
      doesn't seem to be much wrong with that girl.&quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time later she entered the office again and  
      placed a letter, beautifuily typed on his desk. He looked at it with  
      pleasure, but read it with surprise. It was as follows:&quot;24th<br> 
      July, 1976.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mr James Vandenberg,<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His address is on this letter. Here! Take it with  
      yau.&quot;Dear Sir,</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thank you for your letter of yesterday's date.  
      I think the question of the electric motors needs further consideration,  
      and as time is important, it will probably be best if we meet to discuss  
      it. There's that cat outside the mindozv again. Please tell Miss Harper to  
      remove it and keep it away. I've told her before about it. I should take  
      it as a favour if you would lunch with me on Friday next. What's happened  
      to my glass of water this morning? We may then be able to settle the  
      matter finally. I don't like flozvers in the office. Please remove them. I  
      usually lunch at one o'clock. Please let me know if that time will suit  
      you. This letter is zmportant and I want you to type it carefully.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      7. Read the following passage once. Underline the key words while reading<br> 
      and retell the story to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy is fourteen years old and in the ninth grade. He  
      had a part-time job which gets him up every morning at five o'clock. He is  
      a newspaper boy.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each morning, Billy leaves the house at 5:15 to go to  
      the corner where the newspapers are. The newspapers were delivered to the  
      corner by truck at midnight. He always takes a wagon to carry them.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the winter it is still dark when he gets up, but  
      during the rest of the year it is light. Billy must deliver the newspapers  
      to the houses of people on his route in all kinds of weather. He tries to  
      put each paper on the porch where it will be protected from wind and rain  
      or snow. His customers think he does a good job. Sometimes they give him  
      tips.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy earns about $ 70 per month, and he is saving some  
      of the money to go to college. He spends the rest on records and clothes.  
      Once a month, he has to collect money from his customers. Since many of  
      them work during the day, Billy has to collect the money at night.  
      Sometimes, when Billy is sick, his older brother has to deliver the  
      newspapers. Once, Billy's father had to help.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy has seventy customers now, but he hopes to get  
      more soon. Someday, if he gets many more customers, Billy might win a  
      prize for being an outstanding newspaper boy. He wants to win a trip to  
      Europe, but he will be happy if he wins a new bicycle.<br>
