&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The well-known banker, T.J. Ellington, was at one time in his younger days the manager of a New York office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His secretary had been with him for many years, and knew his ways and habits. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She always kept a glass of water on his desk, and knew that he disliked flowers in the office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had a habit of interrupting a letter (when she was writing it down) with a few words on other subjects which had no connection with the letter; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but she knew how to deal with that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was never late, and was always willing to work beyond office hours when necessary. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Therefore, when she left the office to get married, Ellington felt rather sorry for himself. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In those days good secretaries were hard to find. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ellington rang up the office in the city which had supplied him before; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but the woman there said that she had no one suitable. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He tried several other places, but the answer was always the same. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There did not seem to be any secretaries unemployed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it was absolutely necessary for him to find someone, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and at last he rang up the first office again and urged the woman to find a girl who could at least type. </T>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well," she said slowly, "there's Miss Steele." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Good!" cried Ellington. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Send her along at once. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I really must have someone here immediately." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I'm not sure about her," said the woman doubtfully. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Why? Can't she type? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Is she too old?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh, she's quite young. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In fact she's only just left the Secretarial College. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She types very well indeed." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, then, what's the matter? Send her here at once." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "All right, if you say so. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But she's a bit simple." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Miss Steele arrived soon afterwards, and he explained her duties to her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first she refused to accept the post; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> she said that she had had no experience and was not used to such work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But after a further conversation he managed to persuade her to come, at least for a week or two. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She agreed, but her face had a doubtful expression on it as she went out. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> On the following morning Miss Steele arrived at the office ready for work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ellington had one letter to which he wished to reply immediately, and he rang the bell. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Miss Steele came in quietly and sat down, pencil in hand and notebook on knee. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ellington told her to take a letter, and was glad to see that she could write as fast as he spoke. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was soon done and she went out to type it. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well," thought Ellington, "there doesn't seem to be much wrong with that girl." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A short time later she entered the office again and placed a letter, beautifully typed on his desk. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He looked at it with pleasure, but read it with surprise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was as follows: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "24th July, 1976. </T><BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Mr. James Vandenberg, </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <I><T TYPE=SEN> "His address is on this letter. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here! Take it with you. </T></I> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Dear Sir, </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I thank you for your letter of yesterday's date. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think the question of the electric motors needs further consideration, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and as time is important, it will probably be best if we meet to discuss it. </T>
<I><T TYPE=SEN> There's that cat outside the window again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Please tell Miss Harper to remove it and keep it away. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've told her before about it. </T></I>
<T TYPE=SEN> I should take it as a favour if you would lunch with me on Friday next. </T>
<I><T TYPE=SEN> What's happened to my glass of water this morning? </T></I>
<T TYPE=SEN> We may then be able to settle the matter finally. </T>
<I><T TYPE=SEN> I don't like flowers in the office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Please remove them. </T></I>
<T TYPE=SEN> I usually lunch at one o'clock. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Please let me know if that time will suit you. </T>
<I><T TYPE=SEN> This letter is important and I want you to type it carefully. </T></I> <BR>
