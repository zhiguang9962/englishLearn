&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Sylvia and Larry both work for a big company in London. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They work in different departments. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They are having lunch in the canteen. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: We've got a new manager in our department. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: Oh? You hoped to get that job, didn't you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Yes, I did. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: I'm sorry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's too bad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who is it? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who got the job, I mean? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Someone called Drexler. </T> 
<T TYPE=SEN> Carl Drexler. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He's been with the company only two years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've been here longer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I know more about the job, too! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Because I'm the wrong sex, of course! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Yes, that was probably it! It isn't fair. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: What sort of clothes does he wear? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: Perhaps that had something to do with it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeans and a sweater? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: It's possible, isn't it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Do you really think I should wear different clothes? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: Well ... perhaps you should think about it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: I'm not saying you should. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm saying you should think about it. That's all! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> SYLVIA: Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's the only important thing! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LARRY: Hmm. Perhaps it should be the only important thing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it isn't. Not in this company. </T> <BR>
