<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: The table's laid. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Come along, both of you, and let us begin. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: I'm ready; I feel quite hungry. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: So am I; I could eat a horse. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: Well, we haven't got a horse for you, but what we have got is quite nice. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sit there and see how well you can behave. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Remember, you're getting quite a big boy and must learn to eat like a grown-up. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: Does that mean that I can eat more? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: We want you to make a good meal, though we don't want you to stuff yourself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Your place has been laid just like ours. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: What's this little plate for? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: That's for your bread. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Most people eat a little bread with their meat and vegetables. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: Mother, aren't you going to cut my meat up for me any more? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: No, I'm not. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We have put a knife and fork for you and you must learn how to use them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here is your meat; help yourself to vegetables from the dish. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Don't take more than you can eat. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: All right, Mother; may I take some mustard? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: You may, but I don't think you'll like it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You'll find it hot. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now sit up properly; don't lean back and don't lean too far forward. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: And take your elbows off the table-cloth. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: And don't take too much on your fork. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You shouldn't open your mouth wide at meals. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: Don't make a noise when you are eating. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: Good gracious! I think it would be better if I took my plate away to the nursery. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I shan't be able to eat at all if I try to remember all those things. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: Stay where you are. You'll soon learn. </T><BR>
(Chris begins to eat; he puts some vegetables into his mouth with his knife.) <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: What are you doing? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Don't you know that you must never put you knife into your mouth? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: But why, Mummy? It's easier like that sometimes. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: You might cut your mouth. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you want to make your mouth bigger than it is? Use your fork. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: No, I don't. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I might prick my tongue with the points of my fork. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: Well, you must learn not to. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: There, leave the lad alone. He'll soon learn. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Have you finished, dear? Lay your knife and fork on your plate. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No, don't cross them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Put the handles towards you. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: Now, here come the sweets. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here's your plate. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Use that spoon and fork; use your fork more than your spoon. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: But why? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Isn't it polite to use the spoon? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: Of course it is, but most people use the fork more than the spoon. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Use the spoon when you have to. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: You mean for eating very soft stuff? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: That's right. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why, you haven't drunk any water! </T><BR>
(Chris drinks some water and puts his glass down on the left of his plate. <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: Not there. On your right. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: But why? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: Because it is nearer to your right hand. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's handier there. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: All right, Dad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There seems to be a great deal to learn. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Give me some more pudding, Mother. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: "Give me" doesn't get; say, "Please may I have?" </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: Please may I have some more pudding? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: Here you are. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What's that I see? Dirty hands? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> See that you don't come to table with dirty hands again. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> FATHER: And brush your hair next time you come. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: I'll try to remember. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But you mustn't expect me to learn everything at once. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> May I get down now? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MOTHER: Very well. Run along. </T> <BR>
