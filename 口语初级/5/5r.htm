<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Frank and Charles discuss last night's television programme. 
<BR>Frank: Did you watch television last night, Charles?
<BR>Charles: Yes, I did.
<BR>Frank: It was a good game, wasn't it?
<BR>Charles: Oh, I didn't watch the football match. I wanted to, but my wife preferred to see the old film.
<BR>Frank: What a pity! It was quite exciting. Both teams played very well.
<BR>Charles: How did it finish?
<BR>Frank: It finished in a draw. What was the film like?
<BR>Charles: It was quite good. But I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first.
<BR>Frank: Did your wife enjoy it?
<BR>Charles: No, she didn't. After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book.
