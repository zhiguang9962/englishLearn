      How to Make Everybody Happy</strong><br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Peter's uncle lived in the country. Once Peter went to stay  
      with him for a few weeks. Whenever they went for a walk or for a drive in  
      the car and they passed somebody, his uncle waved. Peter was surprised,  
      and said, &quot;Uncle George, you know everybody here. Where did you meet  
      them all?&quot;</font></p> 
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't know all these people , &quot; said his uncle.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then why do you wave to them?&quot; asked Peter.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, Peter,&quot; answered his uncle, &quot;when I  
      wave to someone and he knows me, he is pleased. He continues his journey  
      with a happier heart.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> But when I wave to someone and he doesn't know me,  
      he is surprised and says to himself `Who is that man? Why did he wave to  
      me?' So he has something to think about during the rest of his journey,  
      and that makes his journey seem shorter. So I make everybody happy. &quot;</font></p>
