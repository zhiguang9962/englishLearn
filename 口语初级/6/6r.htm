<BR> Fred: If I won the Pools, I'd go round the world.
<BR> Bert: Would you? I wouldn't.
<BR> Fred: What would you do?
<BR> Bert: Oh, I don't know. I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids, I suppose. But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money.
<BR> Fred: One thing's certain. If I had a lot of money, I wouldn't work any more.
<BR> Bert: Wouldn't you? What would you do with all that spare time?
<BR> Fred: As I said, I'd go round the world.
<BR> Bert: What would you do after that?
<BR> Fred: Oh, I don't know. It'd take me a long time to go round the world.
<BR> Bert: It doesn't sound very exciting.
<BR> Fred: Anyway, we haven't won the Pools, and we're not likely to win them. So there isn't much point in talking about it, is there?
<BR> Bert: I'd be happy if I got a rise.
<BR> Fred: And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat.
<BR> Bert: Well, I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat, so let's come down to earth and have another drink. 
<BR> Fred: What'll you have?
<BR> Bert: I'll have a pint of the best.
<BR> Fred: I'd have a Scotch if I were you. We deserve it.
<BR> Bert: All right. Make it a double, will you?
