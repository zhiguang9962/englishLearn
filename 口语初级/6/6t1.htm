&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Peter's uncle lived in the country. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Once Peter went to stay with him for a few weeks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Whenever they went for a walk or for a drive in the car and they passed somebody, his uncle waved. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Peter was surprised, and said, "Uncle George, you know everybody here. Where did you meet them all?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I don't know all these people," said his uncle. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Then why do you wave to them?" asked Peter. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, Peter," answered his uncle, "when I wave to someone and he knows me, he is pleased. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He continues his journey with a happier heart.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But when I wave to someone and he doesn't know me, he is surprised and says to himself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> ¡®Who is that man? Why did he wave to me?' </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So he has something to think about during the rest of his journey, and that makes his journey seem shorter. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So I make everybody happy." </T> <BR>
