<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Allen go grocery shopping on Saturday mornings. Mr. Allen never enjoys these trips. Mrs. Allen does the shopping and he sits in the car and waits for her. This morning there were a lot of people and it took Mrs. Allen longer than usual. An hour went by and finally a man came up to Mr. Allen. "Excuse me," he said, "is your name Allen? Your wife is waiting for you at the check-out counter. She doesn't have enough money for the groceries!"
