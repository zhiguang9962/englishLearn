&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Jenkins went to her doctor one day, because her heart was giving her trouble. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The doctor listened to her heart carefully and did a few other things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then he said, "Well, Mrs. Jenkins, stop smoking, and then you'll soon be quite all right again." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But doctor," answered Mrs. Jenkins quickly, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I've never smoked. I don't like smoking." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh, well," said the doctor, "then don't drink any more alcohol." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But I don't drink alcohol," answered Mrs. Jenkins at once. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Stop drinking tea and coffee then," the doctor said to her. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I only drink water," answered Mrs. Jenkins. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I don't like tea or coffee." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The doctor thought for a few seconds and then said, "Well, ...  er ... do you like fried potatoes?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yes, I like them very much," answered Mrs. Jenkins. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "All right, then stop eating those," said the doctor as he got up to say goodbye to Mrs. Jenkins. </T> <BR>
