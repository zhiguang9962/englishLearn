Housewife: What do I think of television? Um, um, well, um, it keeps the family at home, the kids don't go out at night so much now, they come straight in from school most of them, they run in and straight, well the television's on when they come in, I watch it myself during the afternoon. Er, well it's <T TYPE=HOT>company</T> really and, er, well, then the kids come home, they eat their tea, I have no trouble with them eating their tea because they just ... well, they don't even look at what they eat, they just sit down and, erm, they eat it and they like the programmes and, and it keeps them quiet while I'm cooking the tea for their dad when he comes home an hour later and tea is ready when the news is on when he comes in, and, er and the news is on or perhaps the football match or something, er, they have to be quiet then, they're not very interested in that themselves, they like the cartoons and things but, em, yeah, well, I think television's great, er, we get on much better in the house now, um, well, we've got things to talk about, erm, you know, if I miss a programme, er, if I'm cooking or something in the kitchen, I miss a bit of what's going on, I mean I have the door open so I can hear, but if I miss a bit then they will tell me, and then perhaps later or perhaps the next day we'll have a chat about it, you know. It gives us something to talk about really. Um, I don't think it hurts the kids, I don't think it's a problem, you know, like, er, it stops them, makes their eyes go funny or something, I don't think it's a problem like that. I don't think it's a problem at all. They've ... they've learned a lot from television, I think, they're always <T TYPE=HOT>piping up</T> with questions and learning a lot from the television. <BR>
