        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the  
        Advantages of Television Outweigh the Disadvantages?<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Television is now playing a very important  
        part in our life. But television, like other things, has both advantages  
        and disadvantages. Do the former outweigh the latter?</font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, television is not only a  
        convenient source of entertainment, but also a comparatively cheap one.  
        For a family of four, for example, it is more convenient as well as  
        cheaper to sit comfortably at home, with almost unlimited entertainment  
        available, than to go out in search of amusement elsewhere. They do not  
        have to pay for expensive seats at the theatre, the cinema, or the  
        opera, only to discover, perhaps, that the show is disappointing.&nbsp;</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"> All  
        they have to do is press a button, and they can see plays, films,  
        operas, and shows of every kind, not to mention political discussions  
        and the latest exciting. football match. Some people, however, maintain  
        that this is precisely where the danger lies. The television viewer  
        takes no initiative. He makes no choice and exercises no judgment. He is  
        completely passive and has everything presented to him without any  
        effort on his part.</font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Television, it is often said, keeps one informed  
        about current events, allows one to follow the latest developments in  
        science and politics, and offers an endless series of programmes which  
        are hoth instructive and entertaining. The most distant countries and  
        the strangest customs are brought right into one's stitting-room. It  
        could be argued that the radio performs this service just as well; but  
        on television everything is much more living, much more real. Yet here  
        again there is a danger. We get so used to looking at it, so dependent  
        on its flickering pictures, that it begins to dominate our lives.</font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other arguments for and against  
        television. The poor quality of its programmes i.s often criticized. But  
        it is undoubtedly a great comfort to many lonely elderly people. And  
        does it corrupt or instruct our children? I think we must realize that  
        television in itself is neither good nor bad. It is the uses to which it  
        is put that determine its value to society.<br>

        2. Children and Television<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housewife: What do I think of television?  
        Um, um, well, um, it keeps the family at home, the kids don't go oot at  
        night so much now, they come straight in from school most of them, they  
        run in and straight, well the television's on when they come in, I watch  
        it myself during the afternoon. Er, well it's company really and, er,  
        well, then the kids come home, they eat their tea, I have no trouble  
        with them eating their tea because they just ...</font></p> 
        <p>　</p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC">&nbsp;well, they don't even  
        look at what they eat, they just sit down and, erm, they eat it and they  
        like the programmes and, and it keeps them quiet while I' m cooking the  
        tea for their dad when he comes home an hour later and tea is ready when  
        the news is on when he comes in, and, er and the news is on or perhaps  
        the football match or something, er, they have to be quiet then,they're  
        not very interested in that themselves, they like the cartoons and  
        things but, em, yeah, well, I think television's great, er, we get on</font></p> 
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC">&nbsp;much better in the house now, um, well, we've got things to talk about,  
        erm, you know, if I miss a programme, er, if I' m cooking or something  
        in the kitchen, I miss a bit of what's going on, I mean I have the door  
        open so I can hear, but if I miss a bit then they will tell me, and then  
        perhaps later or perhaps the next day we' ll have a chat about it, you  
        know. It gives us something to talk about really. Um, I don't think it  
        hurts the kids, I don't think it's a problem, you know, like, er, it  
        stops them, makes their eyes go funny or something, I don't think it,s a  
        problem like rhat. I don't think it's a problem at all. They've...  
        they've learned a lot from television, I think, they're always piping up  
        with questions and learning a lot from the television.<br> 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
        3. Television Is Doing IrreparabIe Harm<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, but what did we use to do before there was  
        television?&quot; How often we hear statements like thisl Television  
        hasn't been with us all that long, but we are already beginning to  
        forget what the world was like without it. Before we admitted the  
        one-eyed monster into our homes, we never found it difficult to occi.spy  
        our spare time.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"> We used to enjoy civilised pleasures. For instance, we  
        used to have hobbies, we used to entertain our friends and be  
        entertained by them, we used to go outside for our amusements to  
        theatres, cinemas, restaurants and sporting events. We even used to read  
        books and listen to music and broadcast talks occasionally. All that  
        belongs to the past. Now all our free time is regulated by the `goggle  
        box' . We rush hom.e or gulp down our meals to be in time for this or  
        that programme.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"> We have even given up sitting at table and hading a  
        leisurely evening meal, exchanging the news of the day. A sandwich and a  
        glass of beer will do-anything, providing it doesn't interfere with the  
        programme. The monster demands and obtains absolute silence and  
        attention. If any member of the family dares to open his mouth during a  
        programme, he is quickly silenced.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whole generations are growing up addicted to the  
        telly. Food is left uneaten, homework undone and sleep is lost. The  
        telly is a universal pacifier. It is now standard practice for mother to  
        keep the children quiet by putting them in the living-room and turning  
        on the set. It doesn,t matter that the children will watch rubbishy  
        commercials or spectacles of sadism and violence-so long as they are  
        quiet.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        There is a limit to the amount of creative talent available in the  
        world. Every day, television consumes vast quantities of creative work.  
        That is why most of the programmes are so bad: it is impossible to keep  
        pace with the demand and maintain high standards as well. When millions  
        watch the same programmes, the whole world becomes a village, and  
        society is reduced to the conditions which obtain in pre -literate  
        communities. We become utterly dependent on the two most primitive media  
        of communication: pictures and the spoken word.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Television encourages passive enjoyment. We become  
        content with second-hand experiences. It is so easy to sit in our  
        armchairs watching others working. Little by little, television cuts us  
        off from the real world. We get so lazy, we choose to spend a fine day  
        in semi-darkness, glued to our sets, rather than go out into the world  
        itself . Television may be a splendid medium of communication, but it  
        prevents us from communicating with each other. We only become aware how  
        totally irrelevant television is to real living when we spend a holiday by the sea or in  
        the mountains, far away from civilization. In quiet, natural  
        surroundings, we quickly discover how little we miss the hypnotic  
        tyranny of King Telly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Television Is Good for People<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TV may be a vital factor in holding a family together  
        where there are, for example, economic problems and husband and wife  
        seem at breaking point. The dangerous influence is surely no more than  
        what all of us are exposed to every day. . . in advertising, in the  
        press.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary and secondary education have improved out of  
        all recognition<br> 
        since the arrival of TV in the home and this is not only because of  
        programmes designed for schools. Through TV a child can extend his  
        knowledge and it provides vital food for his imagination.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000CC"><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
        5. Television Is to Blame<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TV passes on to children the corrupting  
        values of a corrupt society.<br> 
        It's only a matter of time before we can give statistical evidence'of  
        how many criminals society has given birth to in front of the TV on  
        Saturday night.<br> 
        You can blame TV for the fact that children take longer to learn to read  
        these days and barely see the point any more of acquiring the skill. In  
        my opinion watching TV should be strictly confined to  
        &quot;treats&quot;.</font></p>
