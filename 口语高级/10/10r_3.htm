&nbsp; &nbsp;     I think it's a great shame the way educational standards are declining today. I mean, good heavens, when you think of all the millions of pounds the Government have spent on education - new schools, more teachers, new equipment. And yet still you find people who can't read properly, can't even write their names and don't know what two and two are without a calculator. I think it's downright disgraceful. I remember when I was young you went to school to learn. You did as you were told and respected your teachers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Nowadays. Huh, nowadays you get long-haired kids who aren't interested in anything. No wonder they don't learn anything. A bit of discipline, that's what they need. A bit of discipline.<BR>
