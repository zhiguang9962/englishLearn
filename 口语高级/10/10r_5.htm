<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Education Standards Are Higher Than in the Past</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Well, there are a lot of different views on this, but I must say I don't think there's very much hard evidence that educational standards are any worse today than in the past. It all depends, of course, on what you measure and how you measure it, but I think it is probably wrong to imagine that there was some golden age in the past when everything was perfect. Of course it may surprise some people that there has not been an obvious and dramatic increase in the standard of education, given the vast amounts of money spent in this area by successive governments in recent years. But unfortunately, most improvements in education are <T TYPE=HOT>intangible</T>.<BR>
