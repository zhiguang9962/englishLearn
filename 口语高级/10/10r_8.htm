<P ALIGN=center><B>8. People Should Be Made to Love Knowledge and Reading</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about education in the Chinese press. From these reports, and letters from my friends, I know that many students in schools and universities think studying is useless. Some graduate students and even teachers quit study or teaching to become clerks in big hotels, for a clerk in such hotels can get higher pay than a university professor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Government leaders and many scholars have already noticed this and are making great efforts to solve the problem. In the People's Daily I see numerous articles on how to improve education and many reports about government leaders at all levels making various plans.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     These plans all centre on raising the salaries of teachers and professors. Of course, this is very important to education. However, education has two sides, not just those who teach, but also those who learn. Increasing the salary of teachers is just one way to improve education. It will not work without the cooperation of the other determinants, such as students' love of knowledge and reading. Even if the teachers are devoted, it will make no sense if the students are not willing to learn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     How can we make more people love knowledge and reading? First, we all have to realize that knowledge is useful everywhere in society, not just in the classroom. Second, people will love knowledge and reading when they have free access to books and information. Building more libraries and developing fine library services are important to improving education.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I worked for six years in a big public library in China. I saw many people reading book after book. They dreamed of entering universities, not just because higher salaries attract them, but because of their need and love of knowledge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As a <T TYPE=HOT>dedicated</T> librarian, I wish policy makers of our government could spend more on libraries when they plan to improve education.<BR>
