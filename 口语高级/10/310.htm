      Should Students Only Learn from Books?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Try to Find out about Real Life<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my recent tour to Kunming in Yunnan Province, I 
      encountered a young Australian at Liuzhou railway station . I helped him 
      get on board the train with his luggage, and we got to chatting in 
      English. I learned that he was 21 years old, studying Asian literature and 
      history at Sydney University.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What surprised me was that, young as he was, he had 
      travelled a lot, not only in China but also in many other parts of Asia, 
      and he seemed to know so much about the Asian culture and history, and was 
      even familiar with ancient and modern Chinese literature and philosophy 
      masters such as Confucius, Lu Xun, Mao Dun and Guo Moruo. He could speak 
      four languages.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a college student, but he did not confine himself 
      to classroom reading only. He said if one really wants to know the society 
      and the world, he or she should go to the grassroots to see, hear and find 
      out about real life. Besides, many students like him in Australia woi-k at 
      part-time jobs after class so as to earn a living and save enough for 
      travelling.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a bit older than he is. Yet I found myself less 
      knowledgeable<br>
      than he is about many things in the world. Like some of my classmates at 
      college, I often feel conceited for merely being a college student and 
      sometimes I even looked down upon those who failed to enter college. We 
      didn't have to work to earn a living, and took many things for granted.We 
      should not just admire other people's living standard and opportunities. 
      What we should do is to learn their spirit of self-reliance as well as a 
      sense of responsibility for the society they live in.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      II . Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. It Is Not Profitable to Study<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sounds like alarmist talk, but the whole nation 
      faces the danger of believing that it is not profitable to study.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following figures will serve as evidence:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1980 and 1988, more than 4 million primary and 
      middle school students quit school. In 1988 alone, more than 6, 000 
      college students and 2, 000 post-graduate students left school.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, a large number of teachers resigned 
      to find better-paying jobs. In some areas, schools had to close because 
      there were no teachers available.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the country lacks educated people, more than 
      5, 000 college graduates were turned down by the work units to which they 
      were assigned last year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study shows that 35 per cent of the country's 
      population above the age of 15 is illiterate or half-literate. The 
      situation could affect social standards and threaten the survival of the 
      nation.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An article from the Beijing-based Economics Weekly 
      attributed the dangerous situation in education to insufficient funding. 
      China only allocates 3.7 per cent of its gross national product to 
      education, lower than some 100 other countries of the world. China's per 
      capita spending on education equals one-fourth that of other developing 
      countries.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers are poorly paid. According to 1988 statistics, 
      teachers generally earn less than factory workers, bank employees and 
      technological personnel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers' housing problems are more serious than those 
      of other employees. Last year, 38 per cent of the teachers at Qinghua 
      University lived in extremely crowded quarters and 4.5 per cent had no 
      apartments, while 600 single teachers lived in rooms shared by three or 
      four.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tradition over thousands of years that scholars 
      should not pursue material goals has changed. Manp teachers have quit 
      their school jobs to do business. Others say they hope that their children 
      will not become teachers like them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make things worse, the limited funds for education 
      have not always been used in the right way.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1985 and 1986, government auditing departments 
      discovered that as much as 500 million yuan was spent on official 
      buildings, cars and business activities, while many students attended 
      classes in rundown classrooms or even outdoors.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Education Is about Something More Important<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but what is education about? Is it really about 
      facts and figures, learning things by heart-you know, the three &quot;r' 
      s&quot;reading, writing and arithmetic (and that shows somebody can't 
      spell, doesn't it?) No, it gets me really cross.People criticize modern 
      education because some kids don't know their seven times table. Hell, what 
      does that matter in the age of computers and calculators? No, education is 
      about something much more imgortant. It's about teaching people how to 
      live, how to get on with one another, how to form relationships. It's 
      about understanding things, not just knowing them. O.K. seven sevens are 
      forty-nine. But what does that mean? It's not just a formula, you know. I 
      want my kids to understand.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. People Don't Learn Anything Today<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's a great shame the way educational 
      standards are declining today. I mean, good heavens, when you think of all 
      the millions of pounds the Government have spent on education-new schools, 
      more teachers, new equipment. And yet still you find people who can't read 
      properly, can't even write their names and don't know what two and two are 
      without a calculator. I think it's downright disgraceful. I remember</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      when I was young you went to school to learn. You did as you were told and 
      respected your teachers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays. Huh, nowadays you get long-haireil kids who 
      aren't interested in anything. No wonder they don't learn anything. A bit 
      of discipline, that's what they need. A bit of discipline.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Traditional Schools Face Challenge<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Tuesday and Friday, 6-year-old Huang Kan goes to 
      an evening class to learn how to play the piano. He shows little interest 
      in this extra class, but his mother is willing to pay 18 yuan a month for 
      his tuition. He is one of the many only children who in recent years have 
      started attending classes to learn to play musical instruments, or to 
      paint or sing, either on holidays or in the evenings during week-days.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such classes are usually run by individuals. Between 
      ABCs and music, the government can only afford the former. Music and 
      painting are seen as luxury items for Chinese children.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But parents are eager to have the talents of their only 
      children developed. They want their children to learn far more than the 
      Chinese and arithmetic offered by the public schools.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people in education and artistic circles are 
      filling this gap between the parents, wishes and public schools, supply.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past,after-school activity centres were 
      encouraged to provide free classes in dancing, playing the violin and 
      Chinese boxing. But as more and more people become interested and seek to 
      take part, teachers are more difficult to find.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So up grew the practice for parents to show their 
      gratitude to the volunteer teachers by offering them gifts, such as 
      cigarettes, meat and fish, clothing and coupons for commodities in short 
      supply.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the gifts never quite matched up to the work 
      involved and so teachers began to charge for their services.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very quick expansion of the charged service followed 
      with classes being started for adults. These classes included hairdressing 
      and cooking for women, calligraphy and qigong for the elderly and child 
      care for parents. Many young people also went to English classes to 
      prepare for tests to qualify them to go abroad.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are now classes of various kinds in the big 
      cities. In Guangzhou, for example, the third traffic peak hour is from 9 
      to 10 in the evening when people are leaving night schools.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charge for service was started by individuals, but 
      now many cultural institutes have also entered the market.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past two years, they have set up 
      correspondence courses, invited&nbsp; scholars to give lectures and even 
      compiled text-books.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all means that what was once a purely social service 
      has turned into a business. Competition has grown with organizers offering 
      such attractions as the showing of new films and the issuing of diplomas 
      approved by the State's Education Commission.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the institutes, these activities are collective 
      moonlighting. They offer the usually low-paid teachers and science and 
      technology workers the chance of a second pay packet.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students on this market benefit more. Women from Anhui 
      Province applying for baby-sitting jobs can ask for 5 yuan more if they 
      can speak putonghua because parents are concerned that their children 
      would otherwise be affected by local dialects. The skill of typing too can 
      bring extra income.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits that both teachers and students gain from 
      this market show just how highly knowledge is evaluated. At a time when 
      the State cannot invest more in education, such a spontaneous market is no 
      doubt a necessary supplement.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. Education Standards Are Higher Than in the Past<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, there are a lot of different views on this, but I 
      must say I don't think there's very much hard evidence that educational 
      standards are any worse today than in the past. It all depends, of course, 
      on what you measure and how you measure it, but I think it is probably 
      wrong to imagine that there was some golden age in the past when 
      everything was perfect. Of course it may surprise some people that there 
      has not been an obvious and dramatic increase in the standard of 
      education, given the vast amounts of money spent in this area by 
      successive governments in recent years. But unfortunately, most 
      improvements in education are intangible.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      6. Give Students Time to Grow<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With examinations drawing near, the burden on middle 
      school students is becoming heavier and heavier. They have more homework 
      than ever before, and less time for leisure, rest and sleep.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the over-load,most students' health suffers 
      and many become nearsighted. An investigation made in a Honghu middle 
      school shows that: compared with 1985, the number of nearsighted students 
      has increased by 25-30 per cent and a larger proportion of students 
      complain of poor health.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not necessary to keep the students in class all 
      the time. They need to go outside for sports, singing, dancing and other 
      activities. We should create a good environment to let young students grow 
      healthily.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      7. Children Must Learn How to Live<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The realization of China' s modernization relies on the 
      children of today.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Childhood is a time of physical and mental development, 
      so efforts must be made to provide an ideal environment for their 
      development. encouraging intellectual, physical and moral training.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should our children be trained to cope wisely in 
      the future? We should provide them with a good material life, but more 
      importantly, a good spiritual life. Patriotism and communism must be 
      spread among children to stimulate lofty ideals and hard work to enliven 
      the Chinese narion.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China needs talent that has developed morally, 
      intellectually and physically. The practice of only enabling people who 
      receive an education to develop intellectually could result in a 
      deficiency on the part of a generation of children.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to put right the tendency of stressing only 
      intelligence and ignoring moral and physical education and necessary 
      physical work.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of children only receiving a classroom 
      book-learning education, we should encourage them to mingle with society 
      and nature so that they can be more adaptable in society.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      8. People Should Be Made to Love Knowledge and Reading<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about 
      education in the Chinese press. From these reports, and letters from my 
      friends, I know that many students in schools and universities think 
      studying is useless. Some graduate students and even teachers quit study 
      or teaching to become clerks in big hotels, for a clerk in such hotels can 
      get higher pay than a university professor.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government leaders and many scholars have already 
      noticed this and are making great efforts to solve the problem. In the 
      People's Daily I see numerous articles on how to improve education and 
      many reports about government leaders at all levels making various plans.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These plans all centre on raising the salaries of 
      teachers and professors. Of course, this is very important to education. 
      However, education has two sides, not just those who teach, but also those 
      who learn. Increasing the salary of teachers is just one way to improve 
      education. It will not work without the co-operation of the other 
      determinants, such as students' love of knowledge and reading. Even if the 
      teachers are devoted, it will make no sense if the students are not 
      willing to learn.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we make more people love knowledge and reading? 
      First, we all have to realize that knowledge is useful everywhere in 
      society, not just in the classroom. Sec'ond, people will love knowledge 
      and reading when they have free access to books and information. Building 
      more libraries and developing fine library services are important to 
      improving education.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked for six years in a big public library in 
      China. I saw many people reading book after book. They dreamed of entering 
      universities,not just because higher salaries attract them, but because of 
      their need and love of knowledge.<br>
      As a dedicated librarian, I wish policy makers of our government could 
      spend more on libraries when they plan to improve education.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      9. The Modern Methods Have Gone Wrong<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if you asked me, it's all these modern methods 
      that's the problem. In the old days you sat in rows at desks and you did 
      as you were told. You knew what you had to do and you did it-and you kept 
      quiet. Nowadays, my god, the noise in most scbools is deafening especially 
      primary schools. The children wander around-do more or less what they want 
      to as far as I can see. The teacher just sits there or wanders around with 
      them, talking to them. Informal teaching they call it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Discovery 
      methods. Sounds more like a recipe for discovering disaster to me. When 
      do'they have time to learn anything? Too busy wandering about to do any 
      work. And when you look at the youngsters coming to work for me, you soon 
      find out they haven't learnt very much at all.<br>
