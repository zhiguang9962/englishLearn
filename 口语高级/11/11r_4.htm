<P ALIGN=center><B>4. Bringing up Children</B></P><BR>
[Extract from an interview.]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "One reason why the family unit is crumbling is that parents have <T TYPE=HOT>relinquished</T> their authority over children. The permissive school of thought says, "Let the child do what he wants to when he wants to, no matter what it is, don't <T TYPE=HOT>warp</T> his personality, don't <T TYPE=HOT>thwart</T> him, you'll ruin him for life." Because of this we've got a generation of spoilt self-centred <T TYPE=HOT>brats</T> with no respect for their elders. Children always push to see how much they can get away with; if you give them nothing to push against, there are no moral limits, no moral convictions will develop in the children. We have this in the schools ¡ª children have much less respect for their teachers nowadays."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     <I>How do you define respect?</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Realizing that someone else might have desires also. Respect doesn't mean that when someone in authority says "jump" you jump ¡ª that's the military approach ¡ª but young people today, if they have an opinion that's different from yours, then you're the fool and they're right, even if they don't have enough experience to judge."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     <I>How do you feel about children using swearwords?</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I never hear them swear, but I saw one of my daughter's diaries once, and it was full of a word that I'd have spanked her for if she'd said it aloud. Swearing goes against my sensibilities. It's mental laziness. If people aren't allowed to swear they use their brains to find a better word."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     <I>Do you think it's just a matter of convention or do you think there's a deeper moral objection to swearing?</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I think it's not done. It's <T TYPE=HOT>taboo</T> in nice society. We've been taught not to swear, and I think well-brought-up people should avoid it. If I ever hear a woman use "s-h-i-t" I think a lot less of her." (Margaret, 43, American)<BR>
