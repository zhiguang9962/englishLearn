<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Leaving with a Love of China</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Very soon I will be leaving China. I am well aware that three and a half years is not enough time to "understand" China. But I want to express my appreciation for what has been a marvellous experience, made even richer because I worked for the Coal Industry Ministry at Shandong Mining College, first at Jinan, and for the past 2.5 years at Tai'an. Living on campus in the small city of Tai'an, at the foot of Taishan, was a privilege. It gave me a view of China which can never be afforded to those who live in Beijing or Shanghai or any large city. After all, Beijing is not China, any more than New York City is the United States.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Of course there have been hardships, frustrations and difficulties. But that's life, anywhere.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The courtesy, consideration and friendliness which have been extended to me, daily, are precious and lasting. I have traveled over much of China. Most of all, more than all the <T TYPE=HOT>antiquities</T>, battlefields, scenery, coal mines, factories, temples, operas, and the rest, it is the Chinese people who captured my heart - sincere, warm, incredibly industrious, unsophisticated, and capable of deeper, truer friendship than most Westerners can even imagine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I have been welcomed into the homes of many Chinese. I have friends from 3 to 83, peasants, workers, professors, doctors, cooks, drivers. I have known people as they suffer and struggle and laugh and weep and argue and have fun - like all human beings. I have always tried <I>not</I> to "look through American eyes", but to see Chinese as people.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I suggest to those shallow elitists who can't live without their golf "exercise", that they come to Tai'an and carry 100 pounds of cement on a shoulder pole up the 7,000 steps of Taishan. Wonderful exercise, and you can earn 2 <I>yuan</I> a day. Those who complain about transportation difficulties of any kind can watch the <I>lao taitai</I> - the old ladies with bound feet - who walk from their villages and make the <T TYPE=HOT>arduous</T> ascent of Taishan, cheerful and spry. Or ride a bus in any Chinese city at the rush hour, as the Chinese must do every day. (Or any American city; or deal with a Manhattan cabbie.) And those who complain of the bureaucracy should try going to the Social Security Administration in the US when you are one of the poor and powerless.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I hope to come back to China some day. But no matter what, I will never lose what I've been given here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     My thanks to all Chinese for showing me a new, higher standard of strength of character and kindness. And my thanks particularly to the people of Shandong Mining College for their unlimited, <T TYPE=HOT>unstinted</T> loving care.<BR>
