<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Yunnan Makes Efforts to Boost Tourism</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Starting from scratch, tourism in Yunnan Province has made progress by leaps and bounds in the last decade. Only 1,284 foreign tourists went there in 1978, the year when the provincial tourism bureau was established. The figure rose to 121,300 in 1988 - an average annual increase of 25.4 per cent, said deputy bureau chief Miao Kuihe in an interview.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In the provincial capital of Kunming alone, there are 11 posh hotels, with accommodations chiefly for foreign tourists, and nine travel agencies that provide services for them. There are also 10 arts and crafts stores in Kunming with a variety of articles with exotic flavours, including national costumes of the minorities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In such a short time, tourism has asserted its role in the socio-economic development of the province.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Kunming, tourism has provided jobs for 12,000 people. In the whole province 25,000 people work in tourist departments.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Tourism has helped to promote the <T TYPE=HOT>catering</T> trade, transportation service and commerce of Kunming. It has helped to accelerate the city construction and its <T TYPE=HOT>embellishment</T>. Moreover, contact with tourists from afar has widened the horizons of the locals, deputy director of the municipal tourism bureau Peng Shaoxi said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It has become a consensus of local authorities that tourism is a vanguard industry in opening the province to the outside world; it is of strategic importance in economic development, and it represents the orientation of urban construction. In 1988, the provincial government listed tourism as the sixth industry in importance in economic development, said deputy bureau chief Miao.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Now, 29 of Yunnan's municipalities and counties are made open to foreigners, a fact favourable to tourism.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Because of Yunnan's abundant tourist resources, Miao <T TYPE=HOT>envisions</T> still brighter prospects for the tourism of the province.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is estimated that by 1995, Yunnan will receive about 200,000 tourists annually and by 2000, their number will rise to 320,000. Hotels by then should have accommodation for 10,000 people.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     To meet the needs of tourism, appropriate measures are being taken in various aspects, Miao said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In April 1988, a centre was set up providing short-term professional training for three to five months for employees in tourist departments. All the big hotels have their own training section, aiming at improved service. Seven young employees have been sent to the United States to learn management expertise. Dozens of chefs are in Hong Kong to learn various styles of cuisine. And some young employees are sent to college to learn foreign languages as well as professional skills in tourism, Miao said.<BR>
