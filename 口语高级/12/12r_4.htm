<P ALIGN=center><B>4. Advantages of Yunnan to Develop Tourism</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     According to the publicity chief of the provincial tourism bureau, Chen Keqin, on the strength of its distinctive geographic and ethnic features, Yunnan has the following advantages for the development of tourism:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A good number of scenic wonders. They are roughly located in three areas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     First, those in the area centring around Kunming, of which the Stone Forest is one. The spectacular, <T TYPE=HOT>jagged</T> rocky formations that rear their heads to the skies are winning world fame. There are also <T TYPE=HOT>karst caves</T> in this area.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Second, those in west Yunnan with the two ancient cities Dali and Lijiang. The Tiger-leaping Gorge of the Jinsha River deserves a mention. It is 16 kilometres long. The narrowest section of it is about 30 metres wide, which, legend claims, tigers once leapt across. Form the surface of the river to the top of the <T TYPE=HOT>precipitous</T> mountains on the two sides, the height is 3,900 metres. Within the 16-kilometre length of the gorge, there are 18 risky rapids and in so short a distance, the drop of the water is 210 metres, averaging 14 metres for each kilometre. The gorge resounds with the roaring and dashing of huge waves of the racing water.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Third, Xishuangbanna Prefecture in south Yunnan. With its lush tropical forests, the area has many fascinating features, in both natural scenery and cultural life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     <T TYPE=HOT>Genial</T> climate, with all the year mild and springlike. The average annual temperature is 19.3 degrees Centigrade. As a result, the province is a "kingdom of fauna and flora", with a variety of rare animals and birds, such as elephants, snub-nosed monkeys and peacocks, and tens of thousands of varieties of plants.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Rich local or special products. They include fine tobacco, tea, ham, medicinal herbs, marble handicraft articles and the Yunnan baiyao, a medicine for <T TYPE=HOT>haemorrhaging</T> and wounds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Folk customs. Inhabited by 24 minorities, Yunnan has many national folk customs, festivals, traditions, dances, costumes and houses that are of great interest. For instance, the water splashing festival in April, with dragon boat <T TYPE=HOT>regatta</T>, of the Dai people in Xishuangbanna and the torch festival in July, of a few minorities including the Yis, Bais and Sanis, are two of the most famous annual celebrations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     With such a variety of things to see in Yunnan, tourist parties with special purposes have been organized. For instance, there are parties to see the <T TYPE=HOT>azalea</T> blooms of all types in various places; mountain climbing; the folk customs of the minorities; or walking tours through scenic routes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     However, according to the deputy director of Kunming tourism bureau, Peng Shaoxi, there are <T TYPE=HOT>hindrances</T> to Yunnan's tourism.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Woefully inadequate transportation facilities. Foreign tourists often find it hard to get into Yunnan, while those who are leaving are often stranded at Kunming's airport for lack of flights. It often takes 10 days to finish a trip in Xishuangbanna, too long for most tourists.<BR>
