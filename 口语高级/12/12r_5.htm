<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Good Impression about China</B></P><BR>
Editor:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Last May, my wife and I visited Beijing, the capital of your beautiful country, and attended the Fourth World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education. We received a warm welcome everywhere we went. Combining business and pleasure, we visited many areas of the city and met quite a few citizens from all walks of life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     From our visit, we know that China is a great country; we know that the Chinese people are warm and friendly; we know that Beijing is much safer than most American cities. We have told all our friends about our wonderful experiences. In a few years, we hope to return to China and teach for a semester.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Unfortunately, the American people do not see your country as we did. Our television media does not convey the warm hospitality of the people. Our newspapers do not report the steady modernization of the past 10 years, nor do they mention the continuing increase in the standard of living. Sad to say, the American public thinks of China as it was 40 years ago.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The solution to my country's mistaken impressions about China is simple, but it will take time: continue our open door relations; continue our economic trade; most especially, encourage Americans to visit China and experience her friendship and charm!<BR>
