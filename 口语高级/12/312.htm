      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Little Good 
      Will Can Help People Understand Each Other<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we had an American family, the Robinsons, for 
      Sunday dinner.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man is in China on a joint project with the 
      department where Mum works. They work in the same office and as Mum knows 
      a little English she often interpretes for him too, so they got to know 
      each other very well. </font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">He had often 
      expressed his wish of meeting her family, but Mum hardly dared to invite 
      him to our old slum of a place. Now that.we've moved to our new apartment 
      we have a more or less presentable place to entertain him and his family. 
      Granny was the only one who had any misgivings about having &quot;highnosed 
      foreigners&quot; in our house.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came about twelve - Mr. &amp; Mrs. Robinson and 
      their two young daughters about Xiao Hong's age. Mrs. Robinson gave Mum a 
      bunch of fresh flowers, bringing colour, freshness and their good will. 
      Mum did the introduction and it was left to ourselves to get to know each 
      other. As was natural Xiao Hong soon got on very well with the two girls 
      Judy and Annie. They all had a common love for Xiao Hong's little kitten 
      and they had endless fun with it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Robinson was much younger than her husband, but 
      she was friendly and kindly and knows a little Chinese. There was a moment 
      of embarrassment when Granny asked her age. Mum was about to apologize 
      when Mrs. Robinson laughed and said it was quite all right, that she had 
      been here long enough to know it was the Chinese custom. She quite blandly 
      told us that she was thirty-two, almost twenty years her husband's</font> <font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">junior. 
      When they learned that Mum was almost ten years her senior, they were 
      genuinely surprised, for Mum does look quite young. &quot;No wonder you 
      are so good and experienced at your work. I had thought you were fresh 
      from . college! &quot; Mr. Robinson said, perhaps a little flatteringly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course they thoroughly enjoyed the dinner. Iike 
      a perfect Chinese hostess Mum and especially Granny kept stuffing them 
      with food and urging them to eat and to drink, apologizing all the time 
      that &quot;it's-all very meager and coarse fare. &quot; The Robinsons, on 
      the other hand, were loud in their praises and protestations. &quot;We 
      used to hear about Chinese hospitality and now we know what it's really 
      like. How can you describe such a lavish meal as meager and coarse? Any 
      hostess in the West would be proud of such a feast instead of apologizing 
      for it,&quot; Mrs. Robinson said to Mum.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And another thing we don't do in the West is to 
      urge the guests to eat and drink,&quot; Mr. Robinson added. &quot;With so 
      much good things before me I certainly don't need any urging. The problem 
      is rather how to prevent myself from over-eating! But back at home I often 
      had to ask for a second helping and my hostess would feel flattered that I 
      should want more of her stuff. Here you don't even give me a chance to ask 
      for,more!&quot; We all burst out laughing at that.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they rose to leave they thanked us profusely not 
      only for'the excellent dinner, but for giving them such a nice time. 
      &quot;Living in Friendship.Hotel isn't really living in China. Today we 
      feel we are really in China. We' ve learnt much more about the Chinese 
      people and Chinese way of life today than half a year in the Friendship 
      Hotel. You must all come to visit us one day. Or better still, come and 
      see us in the States on day. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judy and Annie were reluctant to go. They made Xiao 
      Hong promise to visit them at Friendship Hotel, telling her not to forget 
      bringing the kitten with her! They insisted on giving everyone of us a hug 
      and a kiss, which quite embarrassed me. I think Granny was really touched 
      when they kissed her. All her misgivings had been dispelled.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It' s surprising how a little good will on both 
      sides can break language and cultural barriers.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l. The 
      Tourist Trade Contributes Absolutely Nothing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      to Increasing Understanding between Nations<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tourist trade is booming. With all this ceming and 
      going, you'd expect greater understanding to develop between the nations 
      of the world. Not a bit of it! Superb systems of communication by air, sea 
      and land make it possible for us to visit each other's countries at a 
      moderate cost. What was once the &quot;grand tour&quot;, reserved for only 
      the very rich, is now within everybody's grasp. The package tour and 
      chartered flights are not to be sneered at. Modern travellers enjoy a 
      level of comfort which the lords and ladies on grand tours in the old days 
      couldn't have dreamed of. But what's the sense of this mass exchange of 
      populations if the nations of the world remain basically ignorant of each 
      other?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many tourist organizations are directly responsible for 
      this state of affairs. They deliberately set out to protect their clients 
      from too much contact with the local population. The modern tourist leads 
      a cosseted, sheltered life. He lives at international hotels, where he 
      eats his international food and.sips his international drink while he 
      gazes at the natives from a distance. Conducted tours to places of 
      interest are carefully censored. The tourist is allowed to see orily what 
      the organizers want him to see and no more.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;A strict 
      schedule makes it impossible for the tourist to wander off on his own ~ 
      and anyway, language is always a barrier, so he is only too happy to be 
      protected in this way. At its very worst, this leads to a new and hideous 
      kind of colonisation. The summer quarters of the inhabitants of the cite 
      universitair are temporarily re-established on the island of Corfu. 
      Blackpool is recreated at Torremolinos where the traveller goes not to 
      eat'paella, but fish and chips.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sad thing about this situation is that it leads to 
      the persistence of national stereotypes. We don't see the people of other 
      nations as they really are, but as we have been brought up to believe they 
      are. You can test this for yourself. Take five nationalities, say, French, 
      German, English, American and Italian. Now in your mind, match them with 
      these five adjectives: musical, amorous, cold, pedantic, naive. Far from 
      providing us with any insight into the national characteristics of the 
      people just mentioned, these adjectives actually act as barriers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;So when you 
      set out on your, travels, the only characteristics you notice are those 
      which confirm your preconceptions. You come away with the highly 
      unoriginal and inaccurate impression that, say, &quot;Anglo-Saxons are 
      hypocriies&quot; or that &quot;Latin peoples shout a lot&quot;, You only 
      have to make a few foreign friends to understand how absurd and harmful 
      national stereotypes are. But how can you make foreign friends when the 
      tourist trade does its best to prevent you?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carried to an extreme, stereotypes can be positively 
      dangerous. Wild generalisations stir up racial hatred and blind us to the 
      basic facthow. trite it soundsl -that all people are human. We are all 
      similar to each other and at the same time all unique.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Leaving with a Love of China<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very soon I will be leaving China. I am well aware that 
      three and a half years is not enough time to &quot;understand&quot; China. 
      But I want to express my appreciation for what has been a marvellous 
      experience, made even richer because I worked for the Coal Industry 
      Ministry at Shandong Mining College, first at Jinan, and for the past 2 
      1/2 years at Tai'an. Living on campus in the small city of Tai'an,at the 
      foot of Taishan, was a privilege. It gave me a view of China which can 
      never be afforded to those who live in Beijing or Shanghai or any large 
      city. After all, Beijing is not China, any more than New York City is the 
      United States.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course there have been hardships, frustrations and 
      difficulties. But that,s life, anywhere.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The courtesy, consideration and friendliness which have 
      been extended to me, daily, are precious and lasting. I have traveled over 
      much of China. Most of all, more than all the antiquities, battlefields, 
      scenery, coal mines, factories, temples, operas, and the rest, it is the 
      Chinese people who captured my heart - sincere, warm, incredibly 
      industrious, unsophisticated, and capable of deeper, truer friendship than 
      most Westerners can even imagine.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been welcomed into the homes of many Chinese. I 
      have friends from 3 to 83, peasants, workers, professors, doctors, cooks, 
      drivers. I have known people as they suffer and struggle and laugh and 
      weep and argue and have fun - like all human beings. I have always tried 
      not to &quot;look through American eyes&quot;, but to see Chinese as 
      people.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest to those shallow elitists who.can't live 
      without their golf &quot;exercise&quot;, that they come to Tai'an and 
      carry 100 pounds of cement on a shoulder pole up the 7, 000 steps of 
      Taishan. Wonderful exercise, and you can earn 2 yuan a day. Those who 
      complain about Yransportation difficulties of any kind can watch the lao 
      taitai-the old ladies with bound feet - who walk from their villages and 
      make the arduous ascent of Taishan, cheerful and spry. Or ride a bus in 
      any Chinese city at the rush hour, as the Chinese must do every day. (Or 
      any American city; or deal with a Manhattan cabbie. ) And those who 
      complain of the bureaucracy should try going to the Social Security 
      Administration in the US when you are one of the poor and powerless.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to come back to China some day. But. no matter 
      what, I will never lose what I,ve been given here.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My thanks to all Chinese for showing me a new, higher 
      standard of strength of character and kindness. And my thanks particularly 
      to the people of Shandong Mining College for their unlimited, unstinted 
      loving care.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      3. Yunnan Makes Efforts to Boost Tourism<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting from scratch, tourism in Yunnan Province has 
      made progress by leaps and bounds in the last decade. Only 1, 284 foreign 
      tourists went there in 1978, the year when the provincial tourism bureau 
      was established. The figure rose to 121, 300 in 1988 - an average annual 
      increase of 25. 4 per cent, said deputy bureau chief Miao Kuihe in an 
      interview .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the provincial capital of Kunming alone, there are 
      11 posh hotels, with accommodations chiefly for foreign tourists, and nine 
      travel agencies that provide services for them. There are also 10 arts and 
      crafts stores in Kunming with a variety of articles with exotic flavours, 
      including national costumes of the minorities.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a short time, tourism has asserted its role in 
      the socio-economic<br>
      development of the province.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Kunming, tourism has provided jobs for 12, 000 
      people. In the whole province 25, 000 people work in tourist departments.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tourism has helped to promote the catering trade, 
      transportation service and commerce of Kunming. It has helped to 
      accelerate the city construction and its embellishment. Moreover, contact 
      with tourists from afar has widened the horizons of the locals, deputy 
      director of the municipal tourism bureau Peng Shaoxi said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has become a consensus of local authorities that 
      tourism is a vanguard ndustry in opening the province to the outside 
      world;it is of trategic importance in economic development, and it 
      represents the orientation of urban construction. In 1988, the provincial 
      government listed tourism as the sixth industry in.importance in economic 
      development, said deputy bureau chief Miao.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, 29 of Yunnan's municipalities and counties are 
      made open to foreigners, a fact favourable to tourism.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of Yunnan' s abundant tourist resources, Miao 
      envisions still brighter prospects for the tourism of the province.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is estimated that by 1995, Yunnan will receive about 
      200, 000 tourists annually and by 2000, their number will rise to 320, 
      000. Hotels by then should have accommodation for 10,000 people.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the needs of tourism, appropriate measures are 
      being taken in various aspects, Miao said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April 1988, a centre was set up providing short-term 
      professional training for three to five months for employees in tourist 
      departments. All th'e big hotels have their own training section, aiming 
      at improved service. Seven young employees have been sent to the United 
      States to learn management expertise. Dozens of chefs are in Hong Kong to 
      learn various styles of cuisine. And some young employees are sent to 
      college to learn foreign languages as well as professional skills in 
      tourism, Miao said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Advantages of Yunnan to Develop Tourism<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the publicity chief of the provincial 
      tourism bureau, Chen Keqin, on the strength of its distinctive geographic 
      and ethnic features, Yunnan has the following advantages for the 
      development of tourism :<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good number of scenic wonders. They are roughly 
      located in three areas. First, those in the area centring around Kunming, 
      of which the Stone Forest is one. The spectacular, jagged rocky formations 
      that rear their heads to the skies are winning world fame. There are also 
      karst caves in this area.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Second, those in west Yunnan with the two ancient cities Dali 
      and I.ijiang. The Tiger-leaping Gorge of the Jinsha River deserves a 
      mention. It is 16 kilome;res long. The narrowest section of it is about 30 
      metres wide, which, legend claims, tigers once leapt across. Form the 
      surface of the river to the top of the precipitous mountains on the two 
      sides, the height is 3,900 metres. Within the 16-kilometre length of the 
      gorge, there are 18 risky rapids and in so short a distance, the drop of 
      the water is 210 metres, averaging 14 metres for each kilometre.The gorge 
      resounds with the roaring and dashing of huge waves of the racing water.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Xishuangbanna Prefecture in south Yunnan. With 
      its lush tropical forests, the area has many fascinating features, in both 
      natural scenery and cultural life.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="Ge"> Ge</a>nial climate, with all the year mild 
      and springlike. The average annual temperature is 19.3 degrees Centigrade. 
      As a result, the province is a &quot;kingdom of fauna and flora&quot;, 
      with a variety of rare animals and birds, such as elephants, snub-nosed 
      monkeys and peacocks, and tens of thousands of varieties of plants.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich local or special products. They include fine 
      tobacco, tea, ham, medicinal herbs, marble handicraft articles and the 
      Yunnan baiyao, a medicine for haemorrhaging and wounds.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folk customs. Inhabited by 24 minorities, Yunnan has 
      many national folk customs, festivals, traditions, dances, costumes and 
      houses that are of great interest. For instance, the water splashing 
      festival in April, with dragon boat regatta, of the Dai people in 
      Xishuangbanna and the torch festival in July, of a few minorities 
      including the Yis, Bais and Sanis, are two of the most famous annual 
      celebrations.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a variety of things to see in Yunnan, tourist 
      parties with special. purposes have been organized. For instance, there 
      are parties to see the azalea looms of all types in various places: 
      mountain climbing; the folk customs of the norities; or walking tours 
      through scenic routes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, according to the deputy director of Kunming 
      tourism bureau, Peng Shaoxi, there are hindrances to Yunnan's tqurism.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woefully inadequate transportation facilities. Foreign 
      tourists often find it hard to get into Yunnan, while those who are 
      leaving are often stranded at Kunming's airport for lack of flights.It 
      often takes 10 days to finish a trip in Xishuangbanna, too long for most 
      tourists.</font></p>

      5. Good Impression about China<br>
      <br>
      Editor:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last May, my wife and I visited Beijing, the capital of 
      your beautiful country, and attended the Fourth World Conference on 
      Continuing Engineering Education. We received a warm welcome everywhere we 
      went. Combining business and pleasure, we visited many areas of the city 
      and met quite a few citizens. from all walks of life.<br>
      From our visit, we know that China is a great country; we know that the 
      Chinese people are warm and friendly; we know that Beijing is much safer 
      than most American cities. We have told all our friends about our 
      wonderful experiences. In a few years, we hope to return to China and 
      teach for a semester.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the American people do not see your 
      country as we did. Our television media does not convey the warm 
      hospitality of the people. Our newspapers do not report the steady 
      modernization of the past 10 years, nor do they mention the continuing 
      increase in the standard<br>
      of living. Sad to say, the American public thinks of China as it was 40 
      years ago.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution to my country,s mistaken impressions about 
      China is simple, but it will take time: continue our open door relations; 
      continue our economic trade; most especially, encourage Americans to visit

      6. Fond Memories of a Trip to India<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least twice I thought about giving up my trip to 
      attend a conference on counseling in India last month. The first time was 
      when it seemed I could never, ever get my visa to India. The second time 
      was after I had the visa and went fo buy my plane ticket. There I learned 
      the ticket I had booked was not available because of a computer error.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I persevered and I am glad, because the trip turned 
      out to be nice although it was too short for me to see much of lndia.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment we landed at Bombay airport, we three 
      women from Beijing were surrounded by the differences in language, people, 
      food, scenes and even traffic-one drives on the right side of the road in 
      China but on the left side in India.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a completely strange place, but I felt easy and 
      safe.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indians we met were so friendly that when each of 
      the participants to the conference was invited to say one thing about the 
      meeting, I said, &quot;I am glad to have this chance to know you beautiful 
      Indian women and hand'some Indian men.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not forget the guard at the exit of the 
      international airport in Bombay who kindly insisted that we wait in seats 
      usually reserved for the guards because the people who were supposed to 
      meet us failed to show up as expected.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I wanted to make a phone call to get somebody 
      to pick us up and could get no coins anywhere, another guard took me to a 
      phone reserved for airport staff .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be a very frustrating experience to miss one's 
      flight and arrive at the destination eight hours later than planried, 
      which is what happened to us after the conference.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it turned out somehow not as frustrating as it 
      might have been. We were at the Coimbatore airport on our way back to 
      Bombay after the conference, and we were to leave for home from Bombay the 
      next evening.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were told that we could not take the 10 a. m. flight 
      as we had planned because our tickets had not been confirmed properly and 
      there were no seats available. But we were told that we could be in Bombay 
      that evening if we took a flight to a nearby airport in Bangalore and go 
      from there to Bombay.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were killing time by measuring the airport's modest 
      waiting room when an airport officer stopped in front of us, introduced 
      himself as the officer on duty at the airport, and assured us that there 
      would be no problem, that things would be straightened out for us, and 
      everything would be all right.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In, half an hour we had our new tickets in our hands.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, before long, we were called to the ticket counter 
      and informed that we would not be able to catch our connection flight at 
      the Bangalore airport because the flight from Coimbatore would be one hoor 
      late. And we would have to take the next flight leaving Bangalore and 
      arriving in Bombay at 8 p.m.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hour later, wben I was thinking how unlucky we were 
      that day, we were lining up for the security check. A young woman in 
      airport uniform approached us and said, &quot;We are so sorry that we 
      failed to arrange your morning flight. We did try, but...&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't hear such words very often when you are upset 
      by travel problems in China, even when you are the victims of the travel 
      service's mistakes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words swept away my bitter feelings at having to 
      spenci. the whole day at airports while we might have been exploring 
      Bombay for the afternoon.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that was one of the several moments when I could 
      not help but fall in love with the Indian people.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fell in love with them earlier when a taxi driver, a 
      quiet old man, followed me and gave me his drinking water to wash my mouth 
      when I got sick halfway to the conference place.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fell in love with them when the children at the 
      school close to the conference building passed by and greeted us with 
      &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;morning&quot; with smiles and a little 
      shyness.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fell in love with them when the college students in 
      Bombay, sitting on steps at the gate, waved to us cheerfully across the 
      street.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I would love to visit India again. I want to see 
      the protected forests and the flowers blooming everywhere and the eharming, 
      elegant women in colourful Saris again, and of course, the India Airlines 
      staff members, too.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to see no beggars along the streets, no 
      slums alongside the beautiful beach in Bombay, no school-age boys serving 
      at the tables in restaurants, to hear no new stories about young wives who 
      are burnt to death because the dowry from their parents failed to satisfy 
      the husbands' families.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I hope India will see more Chinese visitors in the 
      near future and China see more Indian visitors, too.<br>
