<P ALIGN=center><B>2. What Is the Value of Work?</B></P><BR>
Matthew: Chris, what do you think the value of work is?<BR>
Chris: Well, I think it ... in our present-day society ... um ... for most people, work has very little value at all um ... Most of us go out to work for about eight to nine hours of our working day. We do things which are either totally <T TYPE=HOT>futile</T> and totally useless or have very little justification whatsoever, and for most of us the only reason for working is that we need to keep ourselves alive, to pay for somewhere to live, to pay to feed our ... our children.<BR>
Matthew: But surely people wouldn't know what to do if they didn't have to go to work?<BR>
Chris: Well, again this raises the sort of... two main aspects of work ... That one, should we think of work only as ... as a sort of breadwinning process, and this is very much the role it has in current society, or should we take a much wider perspective on work and ... and think of all the possible sort of activities that human beings could be doing during the day? I think the sort of distinction um currently is between say, someone who works in a car factory and who produces cars which are just adding to pollution, to overconsumption of vital resources, who is doing something which is ... very harmful, both to our environment and to, probably society ... um, to contrast his work with someone perhaps like a doctor, who I think in any society could be justified as doing a valuable job and one which incidentally, is ... is satisfying to the person who is doing it.<BR>
Matthew: What do you do? Is your job just a breadwinning process or do you get some satisfaction out of doing it?<BR>
Chris: Well, in the job I ... I do I find that most of the satisfaction ... is a mental one; it's coming to grips with the problems of my subject and with the problems of teaching in the University. Clearly this is the type of satisfaction that most people doing what we call in England "white-collar" jobs ... um ... tend to look for and tend to appreciate in their jobs. This is quite different from the sort of craftsman, who is either working with his hands or with his skills on a machine, or from people perhaps who are using artistic skills which are of a quite different character. Certainly it's becoming a phenomena that people who do "white-collar" jobs during the day, who work with their minds to some extent, although many "white-collar" jobs now are becoming very mindless, people who work on computers, people who ... um ... are office clerks, um ... bank employees, these people have fairly soul-destroying jobs which nevertheless don't involve much physical effort, that they tend to come home and do "do-it-yourself" activities at home. They make cupboards ... um ... paint their houses, repair their cars...which somehow provide the sort of physical job satisfaction ... um that they're denied in their working day.<BR>
