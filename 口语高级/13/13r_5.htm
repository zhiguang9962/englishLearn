<P ALIGN=center><B>5. I Can't Stop Working</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There have clearly been three times in my life when it would have been not only appropriate but reasonable for me to do something other than earn money. Once my father would have supported me while I went to summer school. Once I could have supported myself with savings while I was on strike. And once I would have been supported by my husband while I raised small children.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I couldn't do it. I went to summer school at 9 a.m. and to work at 11 a.m. During the strike I did a radio show and magazine work. And during my maternity leave, after the checks ran out, I started to get nervous. Very nervous. I was having a wonderful time with my children, but there was this little <T TYPE=HOT>flutter</T> in my stomach that said, "You haven't got a dime." For whatever reason, I am not good at joint assets unless my assets are making some substantial contribution.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It's hard to figure out why I can't be more relaxed about this, why I never backpacked through Europe like my friends because I had to be at work. I grew up in a comfortable middle-class home. My father worked very hard too hard, I always thought - to fill the role of working man and the role of Dad, which probably made him just about average for his time. My mother never worked outside her home. It's hard for me to figure out how a little girl in such an environment wound up thinking of herself as a breadwinner before current fashion dictated that she should do so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It probably has a great deal to do with independence, with feeling beholden to no man - and I suppose I do mean man. Mothers worry now about raising daughters who are willing and able to support themselves and their children if their marriages go crash. But I worry about being a woman who is not quite able to relax about her own self-worth and the incalculable value of the domestic functions she performs, not quite able to let the household run for a time driven only by her husband's <T TYPE=HOT>paycheck</T>. It would make sense for me to do that, when my next child is born. For a time, as I did with the other two, I will not work. But the flutter will begin and I will want to have earning power again - not to buy anything in particular, just to know I am still a player.<BR>
