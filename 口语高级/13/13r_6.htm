<P ALIGN=center><B>6. When Taking Home a Paycheck Means More Than Dollars and Cents</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I have worked for money since I was 16 and went to the principal's office to ask for working papers. My problem is that I don't know how to stop, even when it would make sense and be possible to do so for a time. Working for money has always meant something more to me than a bank balance. I suppose I have felt that at some level I am my paycheck. Not how much I take home; if quantity were a real issue I wouldn't be in journalism. Just that, like Everest, the money is there. I need to be on a <T TYPE=HOT>payroll</T> to affirm myself. It doesn't seem like a healthy need; if I were male, of course, it would seem like second nature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It's an interesting concept, money, sort of the way <T TYPE=HOT>respiration</T> is an interesting concept. We're not supposed to care about it too much, especially now, when the bad rap on <T TYPE=HOT>baby boomers</T> is that they've <T TYPE=HOT>forsworn</T> drugs because they can get high from their cash management accounts. To say it's central to who and where we are may be <T TYPE=HOT>verboten</T>; it also happens to be true. If you haven't got any, you're on the streets or on welfare. If you've got a whole lot, you're on the best-seller list and you don't have to play <T TYPE=HOT>Monopoly</T> anymore because in real life the entire boardwalk bears your name.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Most of us fall somewhere in the middle. Most of us need to work to pay the rent, make the mortgage payments. Lots of us convince ourselves that we need to work 60-hour weeks to do that, but that's often because we've let the size of our toys get out of control.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     We've got a gender gap on the issue, too. A man who is not interested in earning money is a ne'er-do-well or a freeloader; a man who is supremely successful is a captain of industry. But society is still more comfortable with women who see earning power in terms of self-protection, not self-promotion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     While it has been fashionable during my lifetime for professional women, plagued by guilt over conflicts between their roles as mothers and as workers, to say that they work because it fulfills them, that's only half the story for me. I also like it because it pays. That makes me feel guilty. I should have better priorities. The new saw about not mimicking male behavior turns out to be an old saw in disguise: we should not be prey to the baser impulses.<BR>
