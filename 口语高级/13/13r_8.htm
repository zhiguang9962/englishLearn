&nbsp; &nbsp;     <I>"I've got happier as I've got richer in direct proportion. For me money buys happiness."</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     For some men the business of making money through work is gratifying and exciting in itself. Their lives are geared towards this and they have chosen their jobs principally for their high financial rewards. For them money is important, not just for what it will buy, but as a badge of success: money and status are inextricably linked. Sometimes the whole family is involved in the quest to "get on", sometimes wife and children have to take second place, but they all have a common aim. They are the competitors, the self-made men, many of them with a well-conceived plan of self-betterment over a five- or ten-year span. Most of them left school without any academic distinction and started in business without any capital resources; they took courses where necessary, worked hard and made their own chances.<BR>
