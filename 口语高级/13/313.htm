      3. The Worst Job<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst job I ever had was as a waitress at a rest 
      stop on the New Jersey Turnpike the summer I was 18. Everyone who passed 
      through the place wanted their food now, and many of them seemed to think 
      that tipping was a nice idea in theory but not in practice. The' pace was 
      manic, and I had to wear a hairnet and white oxfords: Most of the time I 
      arrived at work crying, and drove hotne crying. The only good thing I can 
      say about the experience is that it left me with the most profound respect 
      for people who wait tables and with a pronounced tendency to overhp.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had other jobs, before and after that one. I stuffed 
      jelly doughnuts at a bakery in a bad neighborhood; I called people who 
      were behind on their bills and ordered them to pay up. I was good at 
      doughnuts and bad at threats. After that I bad jobs in the newspaper 
      business only, so I never felt that I had a bad job again. I did not 
      particularly care for working night rewrite on New Year's Eve, but I 
      imagine that makes me just about average.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. What Do You Do, Daddy?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A young boy asks his father, &quot;What do you do, 
      Daddy?&quot; Here is how the father might answer: &quot;I struggle with 
      crowds, traffic jams and parking problems for about an hour. I talk a 
      great deal on the telephone to people I hardly know . I dictate to a 
      secretary and then proof-read what she types. I have all sorts of meetings 
      with people I don't know very well or like very much. I eat lunch in a big 
      hurry and can't taste or remember what I've eaten. I hurry, hurry, hurry. 
      I spend my time in very functional offices wi~h very functional furniture, 
      and I never look at the weather or sky or`people passing by. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">I talk but I 
      don't sing or dance or touch people. I spend the last hour, all alone, 
      struggling with crowds, traffic and parking.&quot; Now this same father 
      might also answer: &quot;I am a lawyer. I help people and businesses to 
      solve their problems. I help everybody to know the rules that we all have 
      to live by, and to get along according to these rules.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="5"> 
      5</a>. I Can't Stop Working<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have clearly been three times in my life when it 
      would have been not only appropriate but reasonable for me to do something 
      other than earn money. Once my father would have supported me while I went 
      to summer school. Once I could have supported myself with savings while I 
      was on strike. And once I would have been supported by my husband while I 
      raised small children.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't do it. I went to summer school at 9 a.m. and 
      to work at il a.m. During the strike I did a radio show and magazine work. 
      And during my maternity leave, after the checks ran out, I started to get 
      nervous. Very nervous. I was having a wonderful time with my children, but 
      there was this little flutter in my stomach that said, &quot;You haven,t 
      got a dime.&quot; For whatever reason, I am not good at joint assets 
      unless my assets are making some substantial contribution.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to figure out why I can,t be more relaxed 
      about this, why I never backpacked through Europe like my friends because 
      I had to be at work. I grew up in a comfortable middle-class home. My 
      father worked very hard-too hard, I always thought -to fill the role of 
      working man and the role of Dad, which probably made him just about 
      average for his time. My mother never worked outside her home. It,s hard 
      for me to figure out how a little girl in such an environment wound up 
      thi.nking of herself as a breadwinner before current fashion dictated that 
      she should do so.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It probably has a great deal to do with independence, 
      with feeling beholden to no man-and i suppose I do mean man. Mothers worry 
      now about raising daughters who are willing and able to support themselves 
      and their children if their marriages go crash. But I worry about being a 
      woman who is not quite able to relax about her own self-worth and the 
      incalculable value of the domestic functions she performs, not quite able 
      to let the household run for a time driven only by her husband , s 
      paycheck. It would make sense for me to do that, when my next child is 
      born. For a time, as I did with the other two, I will not work. But the 
      flutter will begin and I will want to have earning power again-not to buy 
      anything in part.icular, just to know I am still a player.</font></p>

      6. When Taking Home a Paycheck Means<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      More Than Dollars and Cents<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have worked for money since I was 16 and went to the 
      principal's office to ask for working papers. My problem is that I don't 
      know how to stop, even when it would make sense and be possible to:do so 
      for a time. Working for money has always meant something more to me than a 
      bank balance. I suppose I have felt that at?some level I am my paycheck. 
      Not how much I take home; if quantity were a real issue I wouldn't be in 
      journalism. Just that, like Everest, the money is there. I need to be on a 
      payroll to affirm myself. It doesn't seem like a healthy need; if I were 
      male, of course, it would seem like second nature.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's an interesting concept, money, sort of the way 
      respiration is an interesting concept. We're not supposed to care about it 
      too much, especially now, when the bad rap on baby boomers is that they've 
      forsworn drugs because they can get high from their cash management 
      accounts. To say it's.central to who and where we are may be verboten; it 
      also happens to be true. If you haven't got any, you're on the streets or 
      on welfare. If you've got a whole lot, you're on the best-seller list and 
      you don' t have to play Monopoly anymore because in real life the entire 
      boardwalk bears your name.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of us fall somewhere in the middle. Most of us 
      need to work to pay the rent, make the mortgage payments. I.ots of us 
      convince ourselves that we need to work 60-hour weeks to do that, but 
      that's of ten because we've let the size of our toys get. out of control.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've got a gender gap on the issue, too. A man who is 
      not interested in earning money is a ne'er-do-well or a freeloader; a man 
      who is supremely successful is a captain of industry. But society is still 
      more comfortable with women who see earning power in terms of 
      selfprotection, not self-promotion.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it has been fashionable during my lifetime for 
      professional women, plagued by guilt over conflicts between their roles as 
      mothers and as workers, to say that they work because it fulfills them, 
      that's only haif the story for me. I also like it because it pays. That 
      makes me feel guilty. I should have better priorites. The new saw about 
      not mimicking male behavior turns out to be an old saw in disguise: we 
      should not be prey to the baser impulses.<br>

      7. Work Brings Social and Personal Esteem<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these men, work is seen, not so much as a necessary 
      evil, but as an opportunity to use one's skills in a way that gains money 
      and esteem and is quite pleasant in itself. Work is a way of life, a 
      mental challenge, an emotional involvement. The rat race is described as 
      being exciting, and, when high status is combined with high financial 
      rewards, it brings both social and personal esteem, Work can also give 
      scope for male assertiveness;being in a position of command and control is 
      a satisfaction on which several men proudly commented.</font></p>

      8. Work for High Financial Rewards<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I've got happier as I've got richer in direct 
      proportion . For me money buys happiness.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some men the business of making money through work 
      is gratifying and exciting in itself. Their lives are geared towards this 
      and they have chosen their jobs principally for their high financial 
      rewards. For them money is important, not just for what it will buy, but 
      as a badge of success: money and status are inextricably linked. Sometimes 
      the whole family is involved in the quest to &quot;get on&quot;, sometimes 
      wife and children have to take second place, but they all have a common 
      aim. They are the competitors, the self-made men, many of them with a 
      well-conceived plan of self-betterment over a five- or ten-year span. Most 
      of them left school without any academic distinction and started in 
      business without any capital resources; rhey took courses where necessary, 
      worked hard and made their own chances.<br>
