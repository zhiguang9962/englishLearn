Of students from elementary school to high school age in Shanghai, 27 per cent have some kind of emotional disorder, are tired of study, have premature love affairs, smoke or run away from home. In addition, most of them are bothered by impulsiveness, envy, worry or <T TYPE=HOT>melancholy</T>. Not a small number of students show a sense of inferiority, squeamishness, aggression or strong self-will.<BR>

In three main high schools in the southwest of China, of students leaving school, 74 per cent left due to bad health and 42.2 per cent of those suffered from emotional problems and stress.<BR>

They are beginning to mature both physically and mentally. But most of them can not become mature in both these areas at the same time. Some teenagers' emotions remain childish, dependent and impetuous.
