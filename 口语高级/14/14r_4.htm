Me: Mummy. I've been thinking, I think I might go to London at the end of the week.<BR>
Mama: Oh yes?<BR>
Me: Yes, a friend of mine wants someone to share a flat and I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to ...<BR>
Mama: Well, that sounds a very good idea. Where exactly is this flat?<BR>
Me: Well, we haven't exactly got one, but I thought I might go and look - it's easier if you're on the spot.<BR>
Mama: Oh yes, I'm sure it is. I hear it's very difficult to find flats in London these days.<BR>
Me: (<I>my heart sinking as I think of adverts, agencies, Evening Standards, etcetera</I>) Oh no, it's not at all difficult, people get themselves fixed up in no time.<BR>
Mama: Oh well, I suppose you know better than me. What will you live on while you're there?<BR>
Me: I'll get a job. I'll have to sometime, you know. I'll write to the Appointments Board.<BR>
Mama: Just any sort of job?<BR>
Me: Whatever there is.<BR>
Mama: Don't you want a proper career, Sarah? I mean to say, with a degree like yours ...<BR>
Me: No, not really, I don't know what I want to do.<BR>
Mama: I'm not sure I like the idea of your going off all the way to London without a proper job and with nowhere to live ... still, it's your own life, I suppose. That's what I say. No one can accuse me of trying to keep you at home, either of you ... Who is this friend of yours?<BR>
Me: A girl called Gill Slater. She was at Oxford ...<BR>
Mama: And what does she do?<BR>
Me: Oh, She's a - she's a sort of research student.<BR>
Mama: Oh yes? Well, it sounds like a very nice idea. After all, you won't want to stay here all your life <T TYPE=HOT>cooped up</T> with your poor old mother, will you? I shall lose all my little ones <T TYPE=HOT>at one fell swoop</T>, shall I?<BR>
Me: Oh, don't be silly.<BR>
Mama: What do you mean, don't be silly? It seems to me you're very eager to be off.<BR>
Me: You know that's not it at all.<BR>
Mama: Well, what is it then?<BR>
Me: Well, it's just that I can't stay here all my life, can I?<BR>
Mama: No, of course you can't, nobody ever suggested anything of the sort. When have I ever tried to keep you at home? Haven't I just said that you must lead your own life? After all, that's why we sent you off to Oxford, it was always me who said you two must go - I don't know what I wouldn't have given for the opportunities you've been given. And your father wasn't any too keen, believe me. In my day education was kept for the boys, you know.<BR>
Me: Well, you hadn't any boys to educate, had you? You had to make do with us.<BR>
