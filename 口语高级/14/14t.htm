<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Old people are always saying that the young are not what they were.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The same comment is made from generation to generation and it is always true.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It has never been truer than it is today.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The young are better educated.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They have a lot more money to spend and enjoy more freedom.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They grow up more quickly and are not so dependent on their parents.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They think more for themselves and do not blindly accept the ideals of their elders.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Events which the older generation remembers vividly are nothing more than past history.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is as it should be.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Every new generation is different from the one that preceded it.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Today the difference is very marked indeed.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The old always assume that they know best for the simple reason that they have been around a bit longer.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They don't like to feel that their values are being questioned or threatened.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And this is precisely what the young are doing.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They are questioning the assumptions of their elders and disturbing their complacency.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They take leave to doubt that the older generation has created the best of all possible worlds.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What they reject more than anything is conformity.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Office hours, for instance, are nothing more than enforced slavery.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Wouldn't people work best if they were given complete freedom and responsibility?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And what about clothing?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who said that all the men in the world should wear drab grey suits and convict haircuts?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If we turn our minds to more serious matters, who said that human differences can best be solved through conventional politics or by violent means?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why have the older generation so often used violence to solve their problems?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why are they so unhappy and guilt-ridden in their personal lives, so obsessed with mean ambitions and the desire to amass more and more material possessions?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Can anything be right with the retrace?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Haven't the old lost touch with all that is important in life?</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These are not questions the older generation can shrug off lightly.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Their record over the past forty years or so hasn't been exactly spotless.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Traditionally, the young have turned to their elders for guidance.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Today, the situation might be reversed.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The old ¡ª if they are prepared to admit it ¡ª could learn a thing or two from their children.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of the biggest lessons they could learn is that enjoyment is not "sinful".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Enjoyment is a principle one could apply to all aspects of life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is surely not wrong to enjoy your work and enjoy your leisure; to shed restricting inhibitions.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is surely not wrong to live in the present rather than in the past or future.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This emphasis on the present is only to be expected because the young have grown up under the shadow of the bomb: the constant threat of complete annihilation.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is their glorious heritage.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Can we be surprised that they should so often question the sanity of the generation that bequeathed it?</T>
