      The Younger Generation Knows Best<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old people are always saying that the young are not 
      what they were. The same comment is made from generation to generation and 
      it is always true. It has never been truer than it is today. The young are 
      better educated. They have a lot more money to spend and enjoy more 
      freedom. They grow up more quickly and are not so dependent on their 
      parents. They think more for themselves and do not blindly accept the 
      ideals of their elders. Events which the older generation remembers 
      vividly are nothing more than past history. This is as it should be. Every 
      new generation is different from the one that preceded it. Today the 
      difference is very marked indeed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old always assume that they know best far the 
      simple reason that they have lieen around a bit longer. They don't like to 
      feel that their values are being questioned or threatened. And this is 
      precisely what the young are doing. They are questioning the assumptions 
      of their elders and disturbing their complacency. They take leave to doubt 
      that the older generation has created the best of all possible worlds. 
      What they reject more than anything is conformity. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Office 
      hours, for instance, are nothing more than enforced slavery. Wouldn't 
      people work best if they were given complete freedom and responsibility? 
      And what about clothing? Who said that all the men in the world should 
      wear drab grey suits and convict haircuts? If we turn our minds to more 
      serious matters, who said that human differences can best be solved 
      through conventional polities or by violent means? Why have the older 
      generation so often used violence to solve their problems? Why are they so 
      unhappy and guilt-ridden in their pexsonal lives, so obsessed with mean 
      ambitions and the desire to amass more and more material possessions? Can 
      anything be right with the ratrace? Haven't the old lost touch with all 
      that is important in life?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not questions the older generation can shrug 
      off lightly. Their record over the past forty years or so hasn' t been 
      exactly spotless. Traditionally, the young have turned to their elders for 
      guidance. Today, the situation might be reversed. The old - if they are 
      prepared to admit it-coutd learn a thing or two from their children. One 
      of the biggest lessons they could learn is that enjoyment is not 
      &quot;sinful&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="left">　</p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Enjoyment 
      is a principle one could apply to all aspects of life. It is surely not 
      wrong to enjoy your work and enjoy your leisure; to shed restricting 
      inhibitions. It is surely not wrong to live in the present rather than in 
      the past or future. This emphasis orr the present is only to be expected 
      because the young have grown up under the shadow of the bomb: the constant 
      threat of complete annihilation. This is their glorious heritage. Can we 
      be surprised that they should so often question the sanity of t.he 
      generaiion that bequeathed it?<br>

      II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Problems of the Young<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 20 Chinese and American experts discovered 
      that young people of both countries are facing the same probiems of 
      economic and social pressures and lack of confidence.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wayne Meisel, director of the Campus Outreach 
      Opportunity League of Minnesota University, said that under economic 
      pressure American young people have to work hard and most students have to 
      take part-time work in order to support themselves.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Young people today, ?he said, &quot;are 
      stereotyped as apathetic, selfcentred, and concerned only with making 
      money and getting ahead.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these circumstances, he said, young people lack 
      confidence,whicb was not the case in the 1960s when young Americans 
      thought themselves capable of doing anything.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of the different conditions in China, Li 
      Xuequan, director of the, higher education section of the All-China Youth 
      Federation, said Chinese young people are alsc facing economic pressure 
      and are worried about iriflation and corruption.<br>
      Trading has appeared in many Chinese universities as students with 
      something to sell try to make money on campus.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Li said, college students have begun to doubt 
      whether what they are learning in class will help them find work,as many 
      businesses totally ignore students of pure theory.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So people describe students as &quot;a lost generation 
      tired of study&quot;, regardless<br>
      of the causes in society that are shaking their confidence.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to resolve these problems, the Chinese and 
      American experts agreed that youth organizations should call on the whole 
      of society to create favourable conditions for the healthy growth of young 
      people, as well as to enconrage them to meet the urgent needs of society 
      and to challenge the assumption that young people are apathetic and 
      uncaring.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meisel said that since last year he has sent letters of 
      . &quot;challenge to youth&quot; to many young people, urging them to 
      commit themselves to addressing such needs as feeding the hungry, housing 
      the homeless, educating the illiterate, consoling the lonely and sick, 
      serving the elderly,and preserving the environment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The letter says: &quot;Through service, we touch the 
      lives of others and enrich our own. &quot;<br>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Students' Mental Health<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a study conducted in Tianjin, out of 50, 
      000 college students, 16 per cent have suffered from anxiety, nervousness, 
      depression or problems due to the early onset of sexual awareness. Of 
      students from elementary school to high school age in shanghai, 27 per 
      cent have some kind of emotional disorder,are tired of study, have 
      premature love affairs, smoke or run away from home. In addition, most of 
      them are bothered by impulsiveness, envy, worry or melancholy. Not a small 
      number of students show a sense of inferiority, squeamishness, aggression 
      or strong self-will.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Bad psychological health causes serious repercussions in a 
      teenager's individual development. In tliree main high s.chools in the 
      southwest of China, of students leaving school, 74 per cent left due to 
      bad health and 42.2 per cent of those suffered from emotional problems and 
      stress.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During puberty, teenagers go through a period of 
      &quot;changing times? During this time, most teenagers' bodies and sexoal 
      desires develop. They are beginning to mature both physically and 
      mentally. But most of them can not become mature in both these areas at 
      the same time. Some teenagers' emotions remain childish, dependent and 
      impetuous. hf we do not resolve the problems that face t.eenagers, they 
      not only will suffer from them, but they will also probably go astray.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Worries Induce Emotional Problems<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 16 per cent of Chinese college and middle 
      school students have emotional problems caused by concern over exams, poor 
      relationships with their teachers and a lack. of enthusiasm for their 
      studies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students feel depressed, fearing they fall short 
      of their parents' expectations.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unhappy family Tife can also lead to depression.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These conclusions are the result of research into 
      emotional problems among college and middle school students.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a study of 2, 961 urban,and rural college 
      and middle school students,. problems arise most frequently in two groups: 
      students in their first and second year of junior middle schools and those 
      in their last year at senior middle school . or the first year in 
      higher-learning institutions.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The survey also revealed that emotional problems 
      increase as students get older.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The percentage of students with emotional problems in 
      junior middle schools is around 13 per cent, while the figures for 
      students in senior middle school and higher-learning institutions are 19 
      and 25 per cent respectively.</font></p>

      6. &quot;Intimate Elder Sisters&quot; Allay Teenagers' Worries<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiao Lin, a third year junior high school student from 
      Beijing, packed his books and clothes and left home, with tears in his 
      eyes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt his divorced parents never loved him. He felt 
      lonely, but he did not know where to go.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought of 440779, a phone number to reach the 
      so-called &quot;Intimate Elder Sisters&quot;.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day was a day to remember in'his whole life. One 
      of the sisters came to see him, and to his utter enjoyment, spent .the day 
      playing with him .</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;She told me 'The world is not as cold as you 
      think it is. There is so much love here. I love you. Your friends love 
      you.'&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiao Lin stayed at home, trying to fill it with the 
      love he got from his Intimate Elder Sister.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, the Intimate Elder Sisters are Wu Ruomei, I.u 
      Qin, Ge Shujuan and Huang Xiaopo, editors o# the China Chiidren's News. 
      Since they opened the hot line in March 1988, they have received mor.e 
      than 10,000 calls from children across the country.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We hope to ease their troub(es through heart-to-heart 
      chats,&quot; said Wu Ruomei. Many of the children they talked to were 
      disturbed by secrets they felt obliged to keep from both their parents and 
      their teachers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children reach the Elder Sisters every day by phone 
      with a wide range of funny or astonishing questions. &quot;I' m growing 
      into a fatty, sister, and I don't want that,&quot; and, &quot;What do 
      children on other planets look like?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions are not always small and easy to solve. 
      Yet, &quot; Even if we just listen to these children' s sobbing, we' re 
      helping them out of their loneliness,&quot; Wu said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Iittle Yanni called her Elder Sister in Beijing 
      from Wuhan, she was weeping. &quot;Mama is dying from cancer,&quot; she 
      said. &quot;I don't want her to leave me.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After comforting little Yanni, her Sisters informed 
      children in other parts of the country, who sent Yanni and her mother 
      letters and gifts, encouraging them to fight the disease courageously.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Beijing boy refused to be identified on the phone. 
      But he told his Elder Sister his cousin had accidentally injured another 
      child and had to pay all the medical fees. Afraid of informing.his 
      parents, he had stolen 110 yuan from a classmate's home and was discovered 
      later. He was in great distress, but did not know what to do.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wu said to him, &quot;The boy's actions are forgiveable. 
      Once he clears up the situation, he'll.win the trust of others.?Her sense 
      told her that the boy was talking about himself.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the call, Wu wrote to the boy's father, asking 
      them to help the boy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later, a boy appeared before the editors. It 
      was he who had taken the money. Now, a good student in No 20. Middle 
      School of Beijing, he often visits with his Elder Sisters.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the past year, Wu and her colleagues also opened 
      the hot line for a short period in eight other cities in the country. In 
      Nanning, capital of South China' s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, they 
      received 509 calls in three days.<br>
