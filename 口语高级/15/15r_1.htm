<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Benefits of Smoking</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Sir, The essential fact about smoking, which most commentators of recent years seem to have ignored is that cigarettes give a vast number of people a good deal of pleasure a lot of the time. That is why the world smoked almost 5,000,000,000,000 of them last year; approximately 1,200 for every man, woman and child on earth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is not high pressure advertising that makes the Chinese smoke heavily - any more than it was wicked merchants who persuaded the seventeenth century Persians to smoke, despite the <T TYPE=HOT>Shah's</T> <T TYPE=HOT>ingenious</T> punishment of pouring <T TYPE=HOT>molten lead</T> down their throats when they were caught.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There is considerable evidence, surprisingly little publicized by cigarette manufacturers, that smoking produces certain beneficial effects in human beings. Frankenhauser showed that smoking counteracts the decrease in efficiency that typically occurs in boring, monotonous situations, and that smokers improved their performance in complex choice situations while smoking. There is a growing body of evidence that <T TYPE=HOT>nicotine</T> can produce a <T TYPE=HOT>tranquilizing</T> effect during high emotional and shock situations, while on the other hand stimulating concentration in tedious situations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     None of which proves that smoking may not cause cancer or other illnesses. But, as the late Sir Compton Mackenzie wrote, "If cigarettes vanished from the earth today, I believe the world would go to war again within a comparatively short time."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     An <T TYPE=HOT>extravagant</T> exaggeration, perhaps. But certainly tempers would be shorter, nastier and more brutish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;                                                        Yours faithfully, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;                                                               Winston Fletcher<BR>
