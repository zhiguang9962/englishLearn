<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Smokers of the World, Unite</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It can scarcely have escaped the notice of thinking men, I think, being a thinking man myself, that the forces of darkness opposed to those of us who like a quiet smoke are gathering momentum daily and starting to throw their weight about more somewhat. Every morning I read in the papers a long article by another of those doctors who are the spearhead of the movement. Tobacco, they say, plugs up the <T TYPE=HOT>arteries</T> and lowers the temperature of the body extremities, and if you reply that you like your arteries plugged up and are all for having the temperature of your body extremities lowered, especially during the summer months, they bring up that cat again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The cat to which I <T TYPE=HOT>allude</T> is the one that has two drops of nicotine placed on its tongue and instantly passes beyond the veil. "Look," they say. "I place two drops of nicotine on the cat's tongue. Now watch it <T TYPE=HOT>wilt</T>." I can't see the argument. Cats, as Charles Stuart Calverley said, may have their goose cooked by tobacco juice, but are we to deprive ourselves of all our modest pleasures just because <T TYPE=HOT>indulgence</T> in them would be harmful to some cat which is probably a perfect stranger?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Take a simple instance such as occurs every Saturday on the Rugby football field. The ball is heeled out, the scrum half gathers it, and instantaneously two fourteen-stone forwards fling themselves on this person, grinding him into the mud. Must we abolish Twickenham and Murrayfield because some sorry reasoner insists that if the scrum half had been a cat he would have been squashed flatter than a Dover sole? And no use, of course, to try to drive into these <T TYPE=HOT>morons'</T> heads that <T TYPE=HOT>scrum</T> halves are not cats. Really, one feels inclined at times to give it all up and turn one's face to the wall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is pitiful to think that that is how these men spend their lives, putting drops of nicotine on the tongues of cats day after day. Slaves to a habit, is the way I look at it. But if you tell them that and urge them to pull themselves together and throw off the shackles, they just look at you with fishy eyes and mumble something about it can't be done. Of course it can be done. All it requires is will power. If they were to say to themselves, "I will not start putting nicotine on cats' tongue till after lunch" it would be a simple step to knocking off during the afternoon, and by degrees they would find that they could abstain altogether. The first cat of the cats is the hard one to give up. Conquer the impulse for the after-breakfast cat, and the battle is half won.<BR>
