      Passive Path to Death for Non-smokers<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice Trillin was 38 and thought she was in excellent 
      health. Then &quot;this completely crazy thing&quot; happened.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I coughed and a tiny, tiny blood clot took me to 
      get a chest X-ray. Ten days later I had my lung removed.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trillin had lung cancer, the kind smokers get. But she 
      had never smoked a cigarette.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of her cancer remained a mystery until a 
      doctor friend asked if her parents.had smoked. They had.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nobody had ever said anything about passive 
      smoking. I hadn't worried about the question much,&quot; she says.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most scientists hadn't worried about it much either, 
      until studies in recent years showed that passive smoking was causing 3, 
      000 to 5, 000 lung cancer deaths a year among Ainerican non-smokers. Now a 
      study estimates that the toll from passive smoking, including deaths from 
      heart disease and other cancers, may be 10 times that.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tobacco smoke in the home and workplace could be 
      killing 46, 000 non-smokers each year in the United States, the study 
      concludes. That's 3, 000 lung cancer deaths, 11, 000 from other cancers 
      and 32, 000 heart disease deaths.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That would make passive smoking the leading preventable 
      cause of death in the United States after alcohol and smoking itself, said 
      Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the US Office on Smoking and Health. 
      Smoking kills 390,000; alcohol, 120, 000.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No longer are we talking about runny nose or 
      watery eyes or headache or nausea, but a fatal disease,&quot; Davis said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passive smoking has become the principal battleground 
      for the tobacco industry and its opponents in the 1980s. It is no longer 
      merely a health issue, but political and environmental. Cigarette 
      pollution is fouling the air.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We know that the indoor environment is far more 
      polluted than the outdoor environment, &quot; said James Repace of the 
      Environmental Protection Agency indoor air programme. &quot;We've seen 
      that again and again wherever we've looked all over the United 
      States.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people believe smokers have the right to smoke. 
      But they also believe that others shouldn' t have to pay a price.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When you talk about an involuntary risk, the 
      society becomes much more cautious, &quot; said University of 
      California-San Francisco biomedical engineer Stanton Glantz, an 
      environmentalist and anti-smoking activist.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new estimate of non-smoker deaths is controversial. 
      Researchers agree it is preliminary and needs to be confirmed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tobacco industry consultant said the emphasis on 
      passive smoking was misplaced. Many public health officials disagree.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The risk of tobacco smoke &quot; is greater than the 
      risk of radon gas is to non-smokers&quot;, Repace said. &quot;We're 
      talking maybe 40 per cent greater. And if you're talking ahout all the 
      carcinogenic air pollutants that EPA regulates, it,s l00 times<br>
      greater.&quot;</font></p>

      l. Benefits of Smoking<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, The. essential fact about smoking, which most 
      commentators of recent years seem to have ignored is that cigarettes give 
      a vast number of people a good deal of pleasure a lot of the time. That is 
      way the world smoked almost 5, 000, 000, 000, 000 of them last year; 
      approximately 1, 200 for every man., woman. and child on earth.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not high pressure advertising that makes the 
      Chinese smoke heavily-any more than it was wicked merchants who.persuaded 
      ihe seventeenth century Persians to smoke, despise the Shah's ingenious 
      punishment of pouring molten lead down their throats when they were 
      caught.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is considerable evidence, surprisingly little 
      publicized. by cigarette manufacturers, that smoking produces certai'n 
      beneficial effects in human beings. Frankenhauser showed that smoking 
      counteracts the decrease in efficiency that typically occurs in boring, 
      monotonou's situations, and that smokers impro-ved their performance in 
      complex choace situations while smoking. There is a growing body of 
      evidence that nicotine can produce a tranquilizing effect during high 
      emotional and shock situations, whil'e on the other hand stimulating 
      con:cen.tration in tedious situations.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of which proves that smoking may not cause cancer 
      or other illnesses. But, as the late Compton Maekenzie wrote, &quot;If 
      cigarettes vanished from. ihe earth today, I believe the world would go to 
      war again within a comparatively short time.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An extravaga.nt exaggeration, perhaps. But certainly 
      tempers would be shorter, nastier and more brufiah.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Yours faithfully,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      2.Is Smoking a Bad Habit?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, a casual smokery always wonder if smoking is really 
      a bad habit. If it is, why does our country produce such a large riumber 
      of cigarettes every year? (As you know, Chi.na is the largsst cigarette 
      producing country in the world. ) If it is,. why do so many girls adrnire 
      handsome boys with a cigarette on their lip?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends tell me, &quot;Smoking is a waste of money, 
      a cause of disease...&quot; Admittedly, these reasons frighten some people 
      into giving up smoking, but can you ensure that non-smokers will live long 
      without dying in an epidemic or getting killed by a drunken driver? Can 
      you say it is not a waste of money for most non-smokers habitually to 
      spend a lot of money on snacks?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, smoking is only an amusement, like 
      playing cards, reading, etc. Many years ago, when an adult handed me a 
      cigarette and lit it for me, I felt grown up. When I am with friends and 
      have nothing to say, we smoke, consequently we no longer feel embarrassed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, I light a cigarette, watching my loneliness, 
      suffering and nervousness vanishing with the smoke, I can't help saying 
      inwardly: Hello, cigarette, my old friend, I' m coming to meet you again.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Smokers of the World, Unite<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can scarcely have escaped the notice of thinking 
      men, I think, being a thinking man myself, that the forces of darkness 
      opposed to those of us who like a quiet smoke are gathering momentum daily 
      and starting to throw their weight about more somewhat. Every morning I 
      read in the papers a long article by another of those doctors who are the 
      spearhead of the movement. Tobacco, they say, plugs up the arteries and 
      lowers the temperature of the body extremities, and if you reply that you 
      like your arteries plugged up and are all for having the temperature of 
      your body extremities lowered, especially during the summer months, they 
      bring up that cat again.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cat to which I allude is the one that has two drops 
      of nicotine placed on its tongue and instantly passes beyond the veil. 
      &quot;Iook,&quot; they say. &quot;I place two drops of nicotine on the 
      cat's tongue. Now watch it wilt.&quot; I can't see the argument. Cats, as 
      Charles Stuart Calverley said, may have their goose cooked by tobacco 
      juice, but are we to deprive ourselves of all our modest pleasures just 
      because indulgence in them would be harmful to some cat which is probably 
      a perfect stranger?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a simple instance such as occors every Saturday on 
      the Rugby football field. The ball is heeled out, the scrum half gathers 
      it, and instantaneously two fourteen- stone forwards fling themselves on 
      this person, grinding him into the mud. Must we abolish Twickenham and 
      Murrayfield because some sorry reasoner insists that if the scrum half had 
      been a cat he would have been squashed flatter than a Dover sole? And no 
      use, of course, to try to drive into these morons' heads that scrum halves 
      are not cats. Really, one feels inclined at times to give it all up and 
      turn one's face to the wall.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is pitiful to think that that is how these men spend 
      iheir lives, putting drops of nicotine on the tongues of cats day after 
      day. Slavas to a habit, is the way I look at it. But if you tell them that 
      and urge them to pull themselves together and throw off the shackles, they 
      just look at you with fishy eyes and mumble something about it can't be 
      done. Of course it can be done. All it requires is will power. If they 
      were to say to themselves, &quot;I will not start putting nicotine on 
      cats' tongue till after lunch&quot; it would be a simple step to knocking 
      off during the afternoon, and by degrees they would find that they could 
      abstain altogether. The first cat of the cats is the hard one to give up. 
      Conquer the impulse for the after-breakfast cat, and the battle is half 
      won.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Common Sense about Smoking<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often said, &quot;I know all about the risk to my 
      health, but I think that the risk is worth it.&quot; When this statement 
      is true it should be accepted. Everyone has the right to choose what risks 
      they take, however great they may be. However, often the statement really 
      means, &quot;I have a nasty feeling that smoking is bad for my health, but 
      I would rather not think about it.&quot; With some of these people the 
      bluff can be called and they can be asked to explain what they think the 
      risk to their own health is. When this is done few get very far in 
      personal terms. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">The bare fact 
      that. 23, 000 people died of lung cancer last year in Great Britain often 
      fails to impress an individual. When it is explained that this is the 
      eq.uivalent of one every twenty- five minutes or is four times as many as 
      those killed on the roads, the significance is more apparent. The one-ineight 
      risk of dying of lung cancer for, the man who smokes twenty-five or more 
      cigarettes a day may be better appreciated if an analogy is, used If, when 
      you boarded a plane, the girl at the top of the steps were to welcome you 
      aboard with the greeting, &quot;I am pleased that you are coming with 
      us-only one in eight of our planes crashes.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;how many 
      wouid think again, and make other arrangements? Alternatively, the analogy 
      of Russian Roulette may appeal. The man smoking twenty-five or more a day 
      runs the same risk between the ages of thirty and sixty as another who 
      buys a revolver with 250 chambers and inserts one live bullet and on each, 
      of his birthdays spins the chamber, points the revolver at his head,</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      and pulls the trigger. One of the difficulties in impressing these facts 
      on pgople is that, despite the current epidemic of lung cancer, because it 
      is a disease which kills relatively quickly, there are many who have as 
      yet no gxperience of it among their family or friends.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      5. On Smoking -Its History and Harm<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tobacco smoking is believed to have started in Central 
      and South America. Nearly 500 years ago explorers who went there with 
      Columbus brought back to Europe the habit of pipe smoking, which they had 
      Learned from the New World Indians. It was introduced into China from 
      Luson during the Ming dynasty.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the 1900's tobacco was used mainly for cigars, 
      ,chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco and snuff. Cigarettes may first have been 
      made by the Aztecs of Mexico. They smoked shredded tobacco rolled in corn 
      husk covering. Cigarette smoking gained some popularity in Europe during 
      the 1800's. It increased sharply after World War I and again after World 
      War II.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For centuries the smoking of tobacco in cigarettes, 
      cigars and pipes has produced controversy over possible health hazards. 
      Scientific investiBations of smoking and health gained impetus after the 
      beginning of the 20th century, when an increase in lung cancer was noted. 
      But only since the 1950's has sufficient scientific evidence accumulated 
      to make possible a thorough evaluation of the health risk. Although some 
      gaps in knowledge still exist, the information now available is sufficient 
      to permit making sound judgements.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since cigarettes have steadily become more popular than 
      cigars and pipes, investigators have directed their principal 
      consideration to cigarette smoking.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we now know, tobacco contains an organic 
      compound-nicotine. It is the rincipal alkaloid of tobacco, occurring 
      throughout the plant. Nicotine, one of the many&nbsp; substances 
      pharmacologically active in tobacco smoke, exerts an effect on the heart 
      and nervous system in particular. The effect on the nervous system is 
      predominantly tranquilizing and relaxing. There is little doubt that the 
      physiological effects strengthen the habit. So for centuries, some people 
      obstinately believed tobacco smoking possessed medicinal properties.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;It reduced 
      tension and was pleasurable. But in reality, it has turned out to be 
      tragedy. When you smoke, you're breathing in close to a gram of dirty 
      brown tar a day. Even the smoking of only a few cigarettes a day causes 
      many dangerous ailments. An American scientist estimated that smokers who 
      average a package a day for 20 years will lose about eight years of their 
      lives.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with the increase in cigarette smoking, many 
      scientific investigations<br>
      have been undertaken. Overwhelming evidence proves the danger and harm of 
      smoking.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimental, clinical-pathological, and 
      epidemiological evidence indicates that cigarette smoking is the main 
      cause of lung cancer.The risk of developing lung cancer increases with the 
      number of cigarettes smoked per day and the duration of the smoking habit, 
      and it diminishes with the cessation of smoking.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarette smoking was also found to be connected with 
      other types of cancer. It is considered a major factor in causing cancer 
      of the larynx and is associated with cancer of the esophagus. Smoking is a 
      significant factor in the development of oral cancer, and pipe smoking 
      alone or with other tobacco use, is causally related to lip cancer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarette smoking is the greatest cause of chronic 
      bronchitis. A person suffering from chronic bronchitis may have the 
      disease and the cough connected with it, for many years, perhaps for the 
      rest of his life.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarette smoking has also been found to be connected 
      with pulmonary emphysema, a disabling disease of the lungs. The smoking of 
      cigarettes increases the risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and from 
      pulmonary emphysema.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Sm">Sm</a>oking is associated with coronary 
      heart disease. Nowadays this disease accounts for a high percentage of 
      deaths annually. Cigarette smokers are much more likely to die from a 
      heart attack than nonsmokers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking injures blood vessels, speeds up hardening of 
      the arteries and increases the work of the heart. It is one of the factors 
      contributing to high blood pressure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What little we've mentioned above is sufficient to show 
      that smoking is extremely harmful to health. Most peple throughout 
      the.world have come to realize the danger. Nowadays some governments are 
      taking practical measures against smoking. We sincerely advise those who 
      have formed the smoking habit to stop and those who haven,t yet started 
      not to. It is both for your own sake and for the sake of the next 
      generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;A recent 
      survey report says that children exposed to parental cigarette smoke may 
      be put at a higher risk of developing lung disease later in fheir lives. 
      Passive exposure to smoke may. also interfere with normal lung growth in 
      young children. There is a strong association between parental smoking and 
      children' s pulmonary function. Children who recorded the weakest lung 
      function were found to be smokers themselves and to have parents or 
      brothers and sisters who smoked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us join together to launch a mass movement to 
      break this harmful smoking habit, and build ourselves up, healthy and 
      strong, to work hard for the four modernizations.<br>
      </font></p>

      6. Call to Stop Offering Cigarettes!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Chinese, who claim to have invented rules of 
      etiquette, offering igarettes is a way of being hospitable to guests.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When somebody calls, first of all, the host would offer 
      him a cigarette and a cup of tea. In the countryside, hospitable, old men 
      often allow visiting guests to share the long-stemmed Chinese pipe which 
      they themselves are smoking. At wedding ceremonies, brides would offer 
      cigarettes to all guests who came to eXpress their congratulations and 
      light the cigarettes for.each of them one after another.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these were originally aimed.. at displaying the 
      Chinese hospitality and respect towards the guests. But in recent years, 
      the oId tradition has been used as a means to nurse good relations.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even those who never smoke have brand-name cigarettes 
      in their pockets. Whenever they have to seek somebody's favour, they first 
      offer him a cigarette, If the other party turns it down, he is being 
      impolite. If he accepts it he has to do something, for courtesy demands a 
      favour in return.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tobacco contains harmful substances. So offering 
      cigarettes to somebody is equal to doing harm to him, gut neither people 
      who offer cigarettes nor those who take them fully realize it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is even more unhealthy for the host to pass the 
      long-stemmed Chinese pipe or water pipe to the visitor after smoking it 
      beforehand.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I paid a visit to a relative who had just returned 
      from abroad. He was smoking but did not produce one for me. Instead, he 
      placed the cigarette packet on the table and told me: &quot;Cigarettes 
      produce carbon monoxide and nicotine. But if you don't mind this, take it 
      yourself.?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His way of offering cigarettes was unique but worth 
      learning.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people throughout the world are attempting to quit 
      smoking. But to give up the practice, firstly I think, we had better 
      cl7ange the tradetional method of entertaining guests.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to offer cigarettes does not mean one is 
      inhospitable. The cigarette packet is on the table. If you cannot check 
      your craving for one at the risk of your health, you may. But you will 
      have to bear the consequences<br>
      yourself.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better also bear in mind that while you are 
      smoking and harming yourself, you are also polluting the air and hurting 
      others.<br>

      7. Smoking Is a Bad Habit<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking is a bad habit. Firstly, it ruins people's 
      health. Health experts have warned us for years that smoking can lead to 
      heart disease, lung cancer and various respiratory ailments. The World 
      Health Organization says diseases linked to smoking kill at least 2, 500, 
      000 people each year. Research conducted in many countries also indicates 
      that pregnant women who smoke run the risk of having deformed babies. 
      Besides, it has been proven beyond doubt that when a person smokes, he 
      subjects the people around him not only to great discomfort but also to 
      physical harm.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, smoking is extravagant. Smokers, either 
      wage-earners or those who live off their parents, spend a large sum of 
      money on cigarettes, which cost them at least 10% of their expenses each 
      month. What's more, sensible women try to avoid marrying heavy smokers, 
      even though some of them appreciate the image of a handsome young man with 
      a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. A friend of mine, a 
      heavy smoker, has been seeking an ideal wife who will tolerate his 
      extravagant &quot;hobby? but up to now he hasn't found one.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, smoking has a bad impact on the psyche of the 
      smokers. After realizing the bad effects of smoking, many people try to 
      give up smoking. but no matter how hard they try ,some of them just can't 
      resist the temptation to smoke again. Gradually, they lose confidence in 
      themselves and get used to making excuses.<br>
