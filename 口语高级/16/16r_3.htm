<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Pop Stars Live Like the Royalty</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Pop stars today enjoy a style of living which was once the <T TYPE=HOT>prerogative</T> only of Royalty. Wherever they go, people turn out in their thousands to greet them. The crowds go wild trying to catch a brief glimpse of their smiling, colourfully-dressed idols. The stars are transported in their <T TYPE=HOT>chauffeur-driven</T> <T TYPE=HOT>Rolls-Royces</T>, private helicopters or executive aeroplanes. They are surrounded by a permanent <T TYPE=HOT>entourage</T> of managers, press-agents and bodyguards. Photographs of them appear regularly in the press and all their comings and goings are reported, for, like Royalty, pop stars are news. If they enjoy many of the privileges of Royalty, they certainly share many of the inconveniences as well. It is dangerous for them to make unscheduled appearances in public. They must be constantly shielded from the adoring crowds which idolize them. They are no longer private individuals, but public property. The financial rewards they receive for this sacrifice cannot be calculated, for their rates of pay are <T TYPE=HOT>astronomical</T>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     And why not? Society has always rewarded its top entertainers lavishly. The great days of Hollywood have become legendary: famous stars enjoyed fame, wealth and adulation on an unprecedented scale. By today's standards, the excesses of Hollywood do not seem quite so spectacular. A single gramophone record nowadays may earn much more in royalties than the films of the past ever did. The competition for the title "Top of the Pops" is fierce, but the rewards are truly <T TYPE=HOT>colossal<T TYPE=HOT>. <BR>
