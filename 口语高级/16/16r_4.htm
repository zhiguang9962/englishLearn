<P ALIGN=center><B>4. "Pop Stars Certainly Earn Their Money"</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is only right that the stars should be paid in this way. Don't the top men in industry earn enormous salaries for the services they perform to their companies and their countries? Pop stars earn vast sums in foreign currency ¡ª often more than large industrial concerns ¡ª and the taxman can only be grateful for their massive annual contributions to the <T TYPE=HOT>exchequer</T>. So who would <T TYPE=HOT>begrudge</T> them their rewards?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It's all very well for people in <T TYPE=HOT>humdrum</T> jobs to moan about the successes and rewards of others. People who make envious remarks should remember that the most famous stars represent only the tip of the iceberg. For every famous star, there are hundreds of others struggling to earn a living. A man working in a steady job and looking forward to a pension at the end of it has no right to expect very high rewards. He has chosen security and peace of mind, so there will always be a limit to what he can earn. But a man who attempts to become a star is taking enormous risks. He knows at the outset that only a handful of competitors ever get to the very top. He knows that years of concentrated effort may be rewarded with complete failure. But he knows, too, that the rewards for success are very high indeed: they are the recompense for the huge risks involved and if he achieves them, he has certainly earned them. That's the essence of private enterprise.<BR>
