&nbsp; &nbsp;     Once a year, at a special ceremony a few distinguished people are awarded Nobel Prizes. The founder of these prizes was Alfred Bernhard Nobel (1833-1896), a Swedish scientist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Nobel discovered the explosive called <T TYPE=HOT>dynamite</T>. This was much safer to use than earlier explosives. He made a large fortune from this and other discoveries and inventions. However, it saddened him that his explosives were so widely used for warfare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Nobel left most of his money to establish five prizes. They are awarded for services to physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. It is considered a very great honour to win one of these prizes.<BR>
