      &quot;The Only Thing People Are Interested<br>

      in Today Is Earning More Money.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time there lived a beautiful young woman 
      and a handsome young man . They were very poor, but a's they were deeply 
      in love, they wanted to get married. The young people's parents shook 
      their heads. &quot;You can' t get married yet,&quot; they said. &quot;Wait 
      till you get a good job with good prospects.&quot;So the young. people 
      waited until they found good jobs with good prospects and they were able 
      to get married. They were still poor,of course. They didn't have a house 
      to live in or any furniture, but that didn't matter. The young man had a 
      good job with good prospects, so large arganizations lent him the money he 
      needed to buy a house, some furniture, all the latest electrical 
      appliances and a car. The couple lived happily ever after paying off debts 
      for the rest of their lives. And so.ends another modern romantic fable.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We live in a materialistic society and are trained from 
      our earliest years to be acquisitive. Our possessions, &quot;mine&quot;and 
      &quot;yours&quot;, are clearly labelled from early childhood. When we grow 
      old enough to earn a living, it does not surprise us to discover that 
      success is measured in terms of the money you earn. We spend the whole of 
      our lives keepig up with our neigbbours, the Joneses. If we buy a new 
      television set, Jones is bound to buy a bigger and better one. If we buy a 
      new car, we Can be sure that Jones will go one better and get two new 
      cars: one for his wife and one for himself . The most amusing thing about 
      this game is that the Joneses and all the neighbours who are struggling 
      frantically to keep up with them are spending borrowed money kindly 
      provided, at a suitable rate of interest, of course, by friendly banks, 
      insurance companies, etc.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not only in affluent societies that people are 
      obsessed with the idea of making more money. Consumer goods are desirable 
      everywhere and modern industry deliberately sets out to create new 
      markets. Gone are the days when industrial goods were made to last 
      forever. The wheels of industry must be kept turning. &quot;Built-in 
      obsolescence&quot; provides the means: goods are made to be discarded.Cars 
      get tinnier and tinnier. You no sooner acquire this year's model than you 
      are thinking about its replacement.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This materialistic outlook has seriously influenced 
      education. Fewer and fewer young people these days acquire knowledge only 
      for its own sake . Every course of studies must lead somewhere: i. e. to a 
      bigger wage packet. The demand for skilled personnel far exceeds the 
      supply and big eompanies compete with each other to recruit students 
      before they have completed their studies. Tempting salaries and 
      &quot;fringe benefits&quot; are offered to them. Recruiting tactics of 
      this kind have led to the &quot;brain drain&quot;,the process by which 
      highly skilled people offer their services to the highest bidder. The 
      wealthier nations deprive their poorer neighbours of their most able 
      citizens. While Mammon is worshipped as never before, the rich get richer 
      and the poor, poorer.<br>

      1. Wealth Led to Disaster<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all American history, there is no story stranger 
      than that of John A. Sutter. We have read about the early history of San 
      Francisco. When the independence of California was declared in 1846, San 
      Francisco was a small town of some 800 inhabitants. Then, in 1848, gold 
      was discovered on land not far away. This land was owned by John A. 
      Sutter. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Immediately, 
      there was a vast movement of people, not only from the United States but 
      from other parts of the world, toward San Francisco and.the gold fields. 
      This was the famous Gold Rush of 1849. San Francisco grew to three times 
      its size in just a few weeks. Within a year it had a population of over 
      25,000 people. Previously a quiet, pleasant town, San Francisco was 
      changed almost overnight into a rough and crowded city, full of all kinds 
      of adventurers and other strange characters. The same factors that 
      operated to change San Francisce also changed the life of John A. Sutter 
      in an equatly extreme form.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John A. Sutter was a citizen of Switzerland. He had 
      come, penniless, in the spirit of adventure to the United States. He lived 
      and worked for a time in Pennsylvania and finally settled in California in 
      1839, when still a young man of thirty-six. He obtained the rights from 
      the Mexican government to a large track of land in the present area of 
      Sacramento, some seventy miles north of San Francisco on the Sacramento 
      River. Here Sutter established his own private colony. This colony he 
      named New Helvetia. Sutter was an intelligent, well-educated man. He built 
      a fort, inside which he established a large trading post.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;He planted 
      great numbers of fruit trees along the banks of the Sacramento River, as 
      well as hundreds of acres of wheat. He became a very rich man by providing 
      most of the ships that .came to the harbour of San Francisco with supplies 
      both for their own use a.nd for export. Sutter had thousands of cattle and 
      horses on his many acres. Five hundred men, mostly Mexica.ns and Indians., 
      worked regulaily for him. He wrote wrote to his wife and three sons, whom 
      he had left in Switzerland, asking them to come and live with him and 
      enjoy his great success.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in 1848, gold was discovered on Sutter's land:-He 
      was building a saw mill, some distance from his fort. Here, in a stream 
      leading from the mill, one of Sutter's workmen found some pieces of gold. 
      At first, Sutter tried to keep the news quiet. He had dreams of becoming 
      even richer than he already was, perhaps the richest man in the whole 
      world. But, within a few weeks, the news about the gold leaked out. Men 
      descended upon Sutter's land from all directions. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Soon they were 
      coming from all over the United States and even from more distant places. 
      These people moved into the area like a great herd of animals. They killed 
      all of Sutter's cattle, stole his farm produce and tools, and tore down 
      his buildings to obtain wood to build homes for themselves. The city of 
      Sacramento sprang up where Sutter's fort stood. On the site of his saw 
      mill grew up the present city of Coloma.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from becoming the richest man in the world, as he 
      had dreamed, Sutter was reduced to poverty. He finally moved away from the 
      area to a distant part of his land. Here his family arrived to live with 
      him. He began to farm and, with his sons, planted more fruit trees and new 
      fields of wheat. Again he was fairly successful. In 1855 Sutter brought a 
      suit in the Californian courts against the l, 700 settlers, who now 
      occupied the lands he had previously owned. He demanded $ 25 million from 
      the state for the roads, canals, and .bridges that he himsel'f had built 
      but which the state had .taken over. He also asked for a percentage of all 
      the gold mined an his property.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;This suit 
      was decided by the Californian courts in Sutter' s favour. Briefly, Sutter 
      was agai.n a rich and important man. His dream of a private empire, with 
      himself as king and ruler, returned. But then the storm broke again. When 
      the judge's decision was made public, 1.0, 000 people, w,ho were now 
      established in the area and thought they might lose their homes, descended 
      upon the court. They burned the courthouse and tried to hang the judge. 
      They destroyed more of Sutter's property. Later, Sutter's home was set on 
      fire and burned to the g.round. Sutter' s oldest son killed himself; his 
      second son was murdered.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sutter was never able to recover from these last and 
      final blows. He went back east and, in the courts of Washington, again 
      brought a suit to recover what he claimed had been stolen from him, He 
      spent the last fifteen years of his life in this sad manner. Tirelessly, 
      he went from senator to congressman, from one government office to 
      another. Friends tried to heip him, ahd he received various honpurs in 
      recognition of his early work in C.alifornia. But delay followed delay, 
      hoth in Congress and in the government courts. The &quot;General&quot; as 
      he came to be called, died alone in a small Washington hotel room, a 
      broken and bitter man.<br>

      2. What Did Qi Gong Do with His Money?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knows how important money is in the world 
      today. But what did Qi Gong do with his hard-earned one and a half million 
      yuan?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Qi Gong, aged 79, is a well-known calligrapher in 
      China. He became famous the hard way. Born in a poor family, he did not 
      have much schooling until his talent attracted the attention of Professor 
      Chen Yuan, the president of Furen University. For years Professor Chen 
      took him under his personal care and taught him'literature and 
      calligraphy. Professor Chen thought highly of Qi Gong and helped him to 
      find jobs of teaching at several institutions.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years of hard work made Qi Gong an excellent teacher 
      and outstanding calligrapher and painter.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In memory of his teacher Professor Chen Yuan, Qi Gong 
      decided in 1991 to set up a foundation to give awards to both teachers and 
      students who excel in their work. Qi Gong worked day after day at his desk 
      and produced more than 100 works of calligraphy, which he sold for 1, 630, 
      000 yuan. All this money went into the foundation which was namled after 
      his teacher. He did not leave a penny for himself!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think money means to Qi Gong?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      3. Pop Stars I,ive Like the Royalty<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pop stars today enjoy a style of living which was once 
      the prerogative only of Royalty. Wherever they go, people turn out in 
      their thousands to greet them. The crowds go wild trying to catch a brief 
      glimpse of,their smiling, colourfully-dressed idols. The stars are 
      transported in their chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royces, private helicopters or 
      executive aeroplanes. They are surrounded by a permanent entourage of 
      managers, press-agents and bodyguards. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Photographs of 
      them appear regularly in the press and all their comings and goings are 
      reported, for, like Royalty, pop stars are news. If they enjoy many of the 
      privileges of Royalty, they certainly share many of the inconveniences as 
      weil. It is dangerous for them to make unscheduled appearances in public. 
      T hey must be constantly shielded from the adoring crowds which idolise 
      them. Tbey are no longer private individuals, but public property. The 
      financial<br>
      rewards they receive for this sacrifice cannot be calculated; for their 
      rates of pay are astronomical.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why not? Society has always rewarded its top 
      entertainers lavishly. The great days of Hollywood have become legendary: 
      famous stars enjoyed fame, wealth and adulation on an unprecedented scale. 
      By today's standards, the excesses of Hollywood do not seem quite so 
      spectacular. A single gramophone record nowadays may earn much more in 
      royalties than the films of the past ever did. The competition for the 
      title &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; is fierce, but the rewards are truly 
      colossal.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. &quot;Pop Stars Certainly Earn Their Money&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only right that the stars should be paid in this 
      way. Don't the top men in industry earn enormous salaries for the services 
      they perform to their companies and their countries'? Pop stars. earn vast 
      sums in foreign currency-often more than large industrial concerns-and the 
      taxman can only be grateful for their massive annual contributions to the 
      exchequer. So who would begrudge them their rewards?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all very well for people in humdrum jobs to moan 
      about the successes and rewards of others. People who make envious remarks 
      should remember that the most famous stars represent only the tip of the 
      iceberg. For every famous star, there are hundreds of others struggling to 
      earn. a living. A man working in a steady job and looking forward to a 
      pension at the end of it has no right to expect very high rewards. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">He has chosen 
      security and peace of mind, so there will always be a limit to what he can 
      earn. But a man who attempts to become a star is taking enormous risks. He 
      knows at the outset that only a handful of competitors ever get to the 
      very top. He knows that years of concentrated effort may be rewarded with 
      complete failure. But he knows, too, that tlte rewards for success are 
      very high.indeed: they are the recompense for the huge risks involved and 
      if he achieves them, he has certainly earned them. That's the essence of 
      private enterprise.</font></p>

      5</a>. Decent Beggars in Shanghai<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was getting dark when the plane landed at Hongqiao 
      Airport in Shanghai. A woman stepped out into a driving rain.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Madam, you must be from Beijing,&quot; a voice 
      behind her said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking luggage from the woman' s hand, the man said, 
      &quot;The weather in the south is unpleasant, and it rains all the time. 
      The rainy season is coming.&quot; He accompanied her out of the airport.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman thought she was lucky to meet such a 
      warm-hearted. young man. At the bus stop, she thanked him. &quot;It's 
      very. kind of you. I would be drenched through without your help.&quot; 
      She said quite a lot to express her gratitude.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to her surprise, the man stood there smiling 
      and showing no intention of leaving. Glancing around, the woman noticed 
      some passengers getting off the same plane with her were tipping the 
      peopte who helped them. She got the hint, took out a five-yuan note and 
      gave it to the man. Saying &quot;Thanks a lot&quot;, he went away.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man is just one of the estimated 500 
      &quot;decent beggars&quot;, a name Shanghai residents have given these 
      people. Often times, they will appear in groups in the railway station, 
      airport, hospitals, scenic spots. Most of them are fashionably dressed, 
      behave decently, and speak in a gentle way. They carefully observe their 
      &quot;customers&quot;, and from their expression, they try to figure out 
      what their &quot;customers&quot; are thinking about. They will show 
      sympathy for a patient sent to the hospital, with tears in their eyes. Tey 
      will flatter the &quot;customer&quot; until he or she is deeply moved and 
      gives them money in gratitude.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 1, a family went to a park. Just as they 
      entered, a young couple with smiles on their faces came up. The man talked 
      first.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Look1 What a pleasant dayl It is very nice for 
      the whole family to spend the holiday in the park,&quot; he said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman added, &quot;We Shanghai people are often 
      kept indoors by the rain. It is too bad for children in particular. On 
      this fine day, it is quite good for your health to walk in the open.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they began to flatter the.children, saying they 
      were so beautiful and would be promising in the future. They predicated 
      that the parents would enjoy a very happy life with wealthy and devoted 
      sons and daughters. They did not stop talking until the mother gave them a 
      10yuan note. The mother did not feel sorry for giving the money. She said 
      that she had bought good fortune with the money. Some people say it is 
      this psychology that the &quot;decent beggars&quot; cater to in making 
      money.</font></p>

      6. Nobel Prizes<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a year, at a special ceremony a few dist.inguished 
      people are awarded Nobel Prizes. The founder of these prizes was Alfred 
      Bernhard Nobel (1833-1896), a Swedish scientist.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobel discovered the explosive called dynamite. This 
      was much safer to use than earlier explosives. He made a large fortune 
      from this and other di.scoveries and inventions. However, it saddened him 
      that his explosives were so widely used for warfare.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobel left mosi of his money. to establish five prizes. 
      They are warded for services to physics, chemistry, physiology or 
      medicine, literature, and peace. It is considered a very great honour to 
      win one of these prizes.<br>
