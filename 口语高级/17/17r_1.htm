<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Husband and Wife by Arrangement</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Yoshio and Hiromi Tanaka are a young Japanese couple living in the USA while he studies electrical engineering. They clearly love each other very deeply, but, says Yoshio, "We didn't marry for love in the Western sense. We got married in the time-honoured Japanese way. Our parents arranged our marriage through a matchmaker. In Japan we believe that marriage is something that affects the whole family, not just the young couple concerned. So we think it is very important to match people according to their social background, education and so on. Matchmakers are usually middle-aged women who keep lists of suitable young people with information about their families, education and interests. When our parents thought it was time for us to get married they went to a local matchmaker and asked her for some suggestions. We discussed the details and looked at the photos she sent, and then our parents asked her to arrange a¡®marriage interview' for the two of us."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A Japanese marriage interview is held in a public place, such as a hotel or restaurant, and is attended by the boy and the girl, their parents and the matchmaker. Information about the couple and their families is exchanged over a cup of tea or a meal. Then the boy and the girl are left alone for a short time to get to know each other. When they return home they have to tell the matchmaker whether they want to meet again or not. If both of them want another meeting, the matchmaker arranges it, and after that they can decide whether to carry on the courtship themselves. Here Hiromi said with a gentle smile, "Not so long ago, the girl could never refuse to go out again with a boy who liked her, but now she can. I thought Yoshio was really rather nice, so I didn't refuse."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Yoshio continued: "When our parents realized we were serious about each other, they started to make arrangements for our wedding. My family paid the¡®Yuino' money to Hiromi's. This is money to help pay for the wedding ceremony and for setting up house afterwards. We also gave her family a beautiful ornament to put in the best room of their house, so everyone knew that Hiromi was going to marry. Six months after our first meeting we were married. A traditional Japanese wedding is a wonderful ceremony, and our traditional custom of arranged marriages has given me a wonderful wife."<BR>
