      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Romantic Love the Most Important 
      Condition for Marriage?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Choosing a Spouse<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are young and unmarried, you must have in your 
      mind the image of an ideal husband or wife. Most young people like to 
      indulge in fantasies, and your image may ta.ke the form of a certain 
      famous film star or pop singer. But if you are of a practical turn of 
      mind; your &quot;ideal&quot; would be more down to earth, and your 
      &quot;image&quot; would be modelled after what you see around you. Though 
      images do not always coincide with realities (for after all, an ideal is 
      an ideal), it is nevertheless an interesting subject for study, for it 
      tells us what the young people expect from the present society.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Li Yinhe of the Sociological Institute of Beijing 
      University has made a study of a certain amount of matrimonial 
      advertisements, and he found that the present generation of China put 
      great emphasis on, in order of importance, (1) age, (2) height, (3) 
      education as the three most important standards in choosing a spouse. Next 
      comes (4) character and temperament, (5) profession, (6) marital status 
      and personal history, (7) appearance and (8) health.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such order of emphasis is peculiarly Chinese. Other 
      conditions such as religion, race and love, so important to people of 
      other nations are completely missing in Dr. Li,s list. Many foreign 
      scholars are also interested in the Chinese idea of an ideal spouse and 
      they just can't understand why the Chinese men especially set so much 
      store by &quot;age&quot; when they choose a spouse. A man of over forty 
      would want a woman under thirty and a man of thirty would want his future 
      spouse to be under twenty- five. One possible explanation is that youth is 
      almost synonymous with beauty. At least the two words young and beautiful 
      always go together. The Chinese people have not yet discovered mature 
      beauty.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Height definitely is uniquely Chinese in playing such 
      an important role when people choose a spouse. To be eligible a man has to 
      be at least 1.70m. in height. It is said that to a choosy girl, any man 
      under 1. 70m. is considered a semiinvalid! So far no one has offered a 
      satisfactory explanation to such a strange phenomenon.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the third important condition, that of 
      educational level, people find it a puzzle too, because in present day 
      China education doesn't give you high social status, nor does it bring you 
      good pay. Yet both sexes set a great store by it. The thing to notice is 
      that a man with a university education is content to have a wife with 
      senior middle school education while a woman with a university education 
      would never consider a man with only a senior middle school education: Her 
      husband has to be at least a university graduate too, preferably someone 
      with a post-graduate degree.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What conclusion can can we draw from all this? I think 
      that in seeking a husband or wife, we Chinese have not yet freed ourselves 
      from our feudal tradition of arranged marriages. Instead of having our 
      marriages arranged by our parents, we now arrange our own marriages.In the 
      old days stress was put on equal social and economic status of the two 
      families, which was considered a condition of a good match.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Now love 
      marriages boil4down to more or less the same thing, except that stress is 
      no longer placed on the condition of the two families, but on the two 
      individuals themselves. And conditions vary with the trend of the times. 
      Not so long ago it was Party membership that was all important. A girl who 
      was a Party member would not be satisfied with a man who was only a League 
      member. He had to be at least a Party member, and preferably a Party 
      member with a responsible position.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence we are still selling ourselves to the 
      highest hidder. To put it another way: We are still trying to get the best 
      bargain with what capitai we have. Is it so much different from the old 
      mercenary marriage?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Husband and Wife by Arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoshio and Hiromi Tanaka are a young Japanese couple 
      living in the USA while he studies electrical engineering. They clearly 
      love each other very deeply, but, says Yoshio, &quot;We didn' t marry for 
      love in the Western sense. We got married in the time-Itcanoured Japanese 
      way. Our parents arranged our marriage through a matchmaker. ln Japan we 
      believe that marriage is something that affects the whole family; not just 
      tbe young couple concerned. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">So we think it is 
      very important to match people according to their social background, 
      education and so on. Matchmakers are usually middle-aged women who keep 
      lists of suitable young people with information about their families, 
      education and interests. When our parents thought it was time for us to 
      get married they went to a local matchmaker and asked her for some 
      suggestions. We discussed the details.and looked at the photos sbe sent, 
      and then our parents asked her to arrange a 'marriage interview, for the 
      two of us.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Japanese marriage interview is held in a public 
      place, such as a hotel or restaurant, and is attended by the boy and the 
      girl,their parents and the matchmaker. Information about the couple and 
      their families is exchanged over a cup of tea or a meal. Then the boy and 
      the girl are left alone for a short time to get to know each other. When 
      they return home they have to tell the matchmaker whether they want to 
      meet again or not. If both of them want another meeting, the matchmaker 
      arranges<br>
      it, and after that they can decide whether to carry on the coertship 
      themselves. Here Hiromi said with a gentle sinile, &quot;Not so long ago, 
      the girl could never rcfuse to go out again with a boy who liked her, but 
      now she can. I thought Yoshio was really rather nice, so I didn't 
      refuse.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoshio continued: &quot;When our parents realized we 
      were serious about each other, they started to make arrangements for our 
      wedding. My family paid the `Yuino' money to Hiromi's. This is money o 
      help. pay for the wedding ceremony and for setting up house afterwards. We 
      also gave her family a beautiful ornament to put in the best room of their 
      house, so everyone knew that Hiromi was going to marry. Six months after 
      our first meeting we were married. A traditional Japanese wedding is a 
      wonderful ceremony, and our traditional custom of arranged marriages<br>
      has given me a wonderful wife.&quot;</font></p>

      2. Husband and Wife by Airmail<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You must be mad, &quot; his friends said, as 
      thirty-year-old John Briggs of Hatfield left London Airport to fly to 
      Brazil. John was going half-way round the world to meet a girl he'd never 
      seen but hoped to marry. The trip was costing him three months' pay-in 
      fact he' d had to borrow from his father and an aunt to buy his ticket-and 
      he had no idea whether the pretty dark-haired girl he only knew from 
      photographs and letters would even like him. &quot;I' d had a good life as 
      a bachelor,&quot; says John, four years later, his arm round his wife and 
      their two lovely children, &quot;but I felt something was missing. I had a 
      good job, my own house and plenty of friends.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I'd had 
      plenty of girlfriends too, but somehow no one ever seemed quite the right 
      girl for me. Then one day I was looking through a magazine during my lunch 
      hour when a photograph of a pretty girl caught my eye. It was part of an 
      advertisement for a World Penfriends Circle. I decided to write off to 
      them immediately. All my friends had a good laugh, I remember.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John received the names of four girls, two. from Japan, 
      one from Finland, and one from Brazil, and wrote to all of them, enclosing 
      a photograph of himself, The last to reply was Maria from Brazil, but it 
      was Maria who came to take first place in John's heart. They wrote to each 
      other for a year, Maria in Portuguese and John in English- all the letters 
      had to be translated-and then one of Maria's uncles came to Fngland on a 
      business trip. Maria had asked him to arrange a meeting with John and 
      report back to Brazil on what her English penfriend was really like. The 
      uncle said that John was &quot;a fat little fellow without much 
      hair&quot;, but he must. have said some nicer things too, for Maria's 
      parents wrote to John inviting him to visit their family. John replied 
      saying he'd love to.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A practical man, John started to get organized. As soon 
      as he had the money for his air ticket he wrote to Maria asking her what 
      her views on getting married were. He also sent an engagement ring, and a 
      Valentine card every day! Maria wrote back to say they could decide 
      whether to get married or not once they met-but she started making a 
      wedding dress of beautiful white silk, just in case...</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day John was due to arrive Maria waited anxiously 
      at the airport. Suppose h?didn't like her? But when his plane came in she 
      didn't. even recognize himl Her uncle had to point him out. &quot;He was 
      the man with the nicest smiie, &quot; says Maria, &quot;and he was just 
      the right height for me! &quot; They both realized immediately that they 
      were just right for each other in lots of oth.cr ways too. Ten days later 
      they were married and Maria came io live in England with her 
      husband---&quot;the best thing that's ever come to me through the post?she 
      says.<br>

      3. Husband and Wife for </font><font color="#0000CC" size="4">￡</font><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">45 
      Eacb<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attractive Kay Knight is expecting her first baby in a 
      few months' time. She smiled happily at her husband Mike as she told us 
      their story. &quot;I woke up on my thirty-fifth birthday thinking, 'Help. 
      I'm turning into a real old spinster schoolteacher. ' All my. friends 
      seemed to be married with homes and families of their own. But where was 
      I? I love my job-don't get me wrong. I've had a very satisfying career, 
      but teaching other people' s children isn' t the same as bringing up your 
      own.&quot;She'll make a wonderful mother,&quot; said Mike. &quot;I can't 
      think why she wasn't snapped up years ago. But I'm glad she wasn't, or I 
      wouldn't have found her.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did they find each other? &quot;Well,&quot; said 
      Kay, &quot;as a young woman I'd had a few boyfriends, but never anything 
      serious. Then I realized I wasn't even meeting any men, not unmarried ones 
      anyway. So I took a deep breat6 and wrote to a Marriage Bureau. &quot; 
      Iiay ha d to fill in a detailed form and then attend an interview. 
      &quot;It was very thorough, &quot; she said. &quot;They really wanted to 
      make sure I was serious about wanting to get married, and they took a lot 
      of trouble to find out what kind of person I was and the sort of man I 
      thought I'd like to marry. I was told I'd be given three introductions to 
      suitable men for a fee of </font><font color="#0000CC" size="4">￡</font><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">15. 
      If I married one of them, I'd have to pay another </font><font color="#0000CC" size="4">￡</font><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">30. 
      The first introduction was to another teacher, which she didn't think was 
      a good idea, but the second was to Mike.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike took up the story. &quot;I got married when I was 
      a young man of 22, but my wife was killed a year later in a car accident. 
      I was completely shattered. I put all my energies into m.y work and spent 
      many years abroad with my firm. Then I came back to England. to work at 
      Head Office and realized how empty my life had become. 1 didn't just want 
      to work; I wanted a wife and children. I needed someone to make my house 
      into a home. I wasn't interested in young girls, but how cowld I find a 
      mature, loving woman to share my life? I think my sister and 
      brother-in-law must have g,uessed how I was feeling. They introduced me to 
      a charming older couple one evening. After they'd. gone home I remarked 
      how well-suited they seerned and my sister told me why--they'd met through 
      a Marriage Bureau. `You should give it a try,' she said. So I did.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike phoned a bureau the very next day and went for an 
      interview the following week. He was given three names, including Kay's. 
      He wrote to her first because he thought a school-teacher would probably 
      like ch:ildren. Their first date was a disaster. &quot;We agreed to meet 
      for a picnic and it poured with rain, &quot; he told us. &quot;But we both 
      saw the funny side of it, and from then on everything went right.&quot; 
      Within'a month o# their first meeting he proposed and they got engaged. 
      The wedding took place a year ago. &quot;Speaking as a businessman, &quot; 
      said Mike, &quot;this is the best deal I've ever made!&quot;<br>

      4. Dating Pattens in the USA<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the traditional dating pattern in the United 
      States,much of the responsibility for a date falls to the young man. In 
      this pattern, the young man must first call fhe girl he wishes to date on 
      the telephone. Usually, this call is made quite early in a week. Most 
      girls iwtraditional dating relationships expect to get a telephone call 
      from a young man by Wednesday. Most dating occurs on weekends. Many young 
      ,people do not have to get up early for school or work on Saturday and 
      Sunday mornings, so Friday nights and Saturday nights are popular nights 
      for dates. The young man must ask the girl for the date, and suggest some 
      things that they might.do together. It is usually up to the young man to 
      pay for all of the evening's activities.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things to do on dates. Many young people 
      enjoy going to sports events, such as football and baseball games. These 
      games may occur at a high school, college, or in a large sports arena in a 
      city. A very popular place for young people to go on dates is the movies. 
      Almost everyone enjoys a good movie, and almost every town has at least 
      one movie theater. Young people may also enjoy going to a night club or 
      coffee house. Here, they may listen to music and dance, and perhaps meet 
      some of their friends. These are a few of the things young people do on 
      dates in the United States.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some parts of the United States, traditional dating 
      relationships begin when young people are in high school. In other places, 
      young people do not go out in couples until they are in college, or in 
      their early twenties. Some young men would rather go out with just one 
      girl all of the time. Every Saturday night, a young man will go out with 
      the same girl. Many girls enjoy this kind of relationship also. It gives 
      both the boy and the girl a chance to get to know one another quite well. 
      Sometimes, this may lead to marriage. Other young people enjoy dating 
      different individuals. One week they may go out with one person, the next 
      week with another. They get to know many people this way, and may not wish 
      to have a serious relationship with just one person.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many young people in the United States, especially 
      college students, do not go out on either of these traditional dates. 
      Instead, they go out on group dates. In this kind of dating pattern, small 
      groups of young people go out together. All of the people in the group are 
      usually friends, but some of the people in the group may not know each 
      other. No one young man is with any particular girl. They are all together<br>
      as part of the group. This is very different from the traditional date.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="A">A</a> group date differs from a traditional 
      date in several ways. First, there are no special relationships in the 
      group. No particular girl and boy are together all the time. Second, the 
      group date may occur on a weekend, but it may not be planned in advance. A 
      group of young people may decide on Saturday afternoon that they want to 
      spend Saturday evening together. They may all decide to go to a movies or 
      to some other event. On a group date, no one is paired with anyone else. 
      As a result, every person pays for his or her own expenses. This means 
      that the girls must pay for themselves. They must pay their own admission 
      for the movies, for a cup of coffee, or for anything else that costs money 
      during the date.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many young people find the group date to be a great 
      deal of fun. The young men on a group date are under no pressure. They do 
      not have to be with any particular girl during the evening. They do not 
      have to pay for anyone but themselves. They do not have to be especially 
      polite or formal during the date. Everyone can relax and have a good time. 
      Group dates may lead to serious relationships for some members of the 
      group. Maybe a girl and boy on a group date find that t6ey have a lot in 
      common and enjoy being together. They may spend more time together, with 
      the group, and with each other. But usually, everyone on a group date is 
      just interested in a good time. No one worries about a serious 
      relationship.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group date may be good for very young people. They 
      may not know what kind of person they like. They may like to spend their 
      time with many different people. But it also does not give young people a 
      chance to have a serious relationsh:p. A serious relationship can help a 
      young person in many ways. A person may learn what is good and what is bad 
      about a serious relationship. Usually, in dating, young people find out 
      what kind of person they would like to marry. If a young person always 
      goes on group dates, there is no chance to find out. As we can see, group 
      dates have their good points and their drawbacks.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group date is very different from the traditional 
      date, don't you think? Young people in the United States today enjoy both 
      of these types of relationships. Traditional dating relationships give 
      young people a chance to get to know one another quite well. Group dates 
      give young people a chance to get to know many other young people and to 
      have a more relaxed evening. Both kinds of dates have their good points. 
      The group date is a.relatively new idea among young people. It.seems to be 
      popular for the reasons described here.</font></p>

      5. Courtship Customs<br>
      <br>
      Did you know<br>
      that most British couples first meet at a dance?<br>
      that in some parts of Africa. men pay for their wives with cows?<br>
      that in Germany you can advertise for a partner on television?<br>
      that in Britain girls can propose in Leap Year ( 1976, I980 and every 
      fourth year following)?<br>
      that in the USA boys and girls start dating very young, as young as 12?</font></p>

      6. Marriage : East and West<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I believe,&quot; said Dr. Samuel Johnson in the 
      eighteenfh century, &quot;that marriages would in general be as happy, and 
      often more so, if they were all made by the Lord Chancel'lor, upon a due 
      consideration of the characters and circumstances, without the partners 
      having any choice in the matter.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are bound to acknowledge, after a careful study of 
      the methods of mate selection in the East and West, that the great Dr. 
      Johnson was probably perfectly right.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From one extreme to the other, four patterns of mate 
      selection may be distinguished.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Selection by the parents - the young people 
      themselves not consulted. This is the traditional method employed in the 
      East. When the choice is carefully and wisely made, it is usually a good 
      one.But it is open to the grave errors caused by ignorance and 
      exploitation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Selection by the parents, but the young People 
      consulted . This is an improvement on the first method, provided the young 
      people are allowed to make the final decision. In some communities, though 
      they are formally consulted, they are expected to accept the choice made 
      for them, and have no real freedom to express their minds.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Selection by the young people, but parental approvdl 
      necessary. This pattern exhibits at least two forms. The strictest is the 
      one in which no action may be taken by the young people until they bave 
      been given parental permissiop to proceed. A good example is the early 
      American Quaker father in the eighteenth century, who was approached by a 
      neighbour's son John asking his permission to court his daughter Sarah. 
      Unless John was approved by Sazah's father in the first place, no further<br>
      step could be taken. But even if her father approved of John, Sarah still 
      had the right to refuse him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other variation is where Sarah could encourage 
      John's attentions without seeking her father's permission; but if she and 
      John became serious, her father's approval was essential before marriage 
      could take place. If he used his veto, she had to give up John-or elope!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Selection by the young people - the parents not 
      consulted. This is the method which is becoming widespread in the West 
      today. The couple may be living away from home, and unable to consult 
      their parents. But even when the parents are formally consulted, all too 
      often their agreement is a mere formality. They know that, even if they 
      raise objections, the marriage is likely to take place anyway.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of these methods is most desirable?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would reject the first. Even if it is efficient, we 
      believe it denies to young people a freedom that should be theirs by 
      right. This is the position being widely adopted in the East today.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would also reject the last. Young people should not 
      be dominated<br>
      by their parents in this matter. But neither should their parents be left 
      entirely out of the picture. The experience of parents can often correct 
      and restrain the headstrong and distorted choices of inexperienced youth. 
      The kind of freedom young people in the West today are demanding is 
      unreasonable, and undesirable in their own best interests.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The desirable ideal, we believe, is a cooperative 
      selection by young people and parents together. This may not always be 
      easily achieved.But it is worth the effort that may be needed. It creates 
      unity in ihe family. It balances out the intense feelings of youth against 
      the detached judgement of more mature experience. It offers, we believe, 
      the best basis for successful marriages - especially if backed by 
      scientific knowledge accumulated by study and research.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the present time, the East.is moving steadily 
      towards the ideal of cooperation between parents and young people. But the 
      West is moving further away from it, as young people increasingly ignore 
      their parents' opinions. However, there is some compensation in the fact 
      that the results of study:and research concerning the criteria of good 
      mate selection are being made available increasingly to Western youth.</font></p>

      7. Marry - for What?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid it is in the nature of an agony aunt's job 
      that she is more concerned with failures than with triumphs. Nevertheless, 
      these past years, I've also noticed something of the pattern that leads to 
      success in married life.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen, for instance, that making a marriage work 
      begins long before making a marriage. It begins with a girl who thinks 
      less about marriage than girls have traditionally done, and more about 
      herself in relationship to work and to her community. The very first trick 
      to a happy marriage is to become a person of independence and pride who 
      does not imagine a husband is necessary to make her magically complete.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I get a letter from a woman who says she 
      &quot;cannot live without&quot; the man who is breaking her' heart, I am 
      compelled to tell her that successful partnerships are not between those 
      who cannot live without each other, but bet.ween those who can live with 
      each other. There is no room even in daydreams for the stupid idea that 
      there is on earth only one mate intended for another.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my surprise I have found this antique misconception 
      is still alive and it creates a lazy superstition that has caused more 
      than one marriage to fail. How can anyone who believes her union was 
      &quot;meant to be&quot;, not equally believe it was &quot;not meant to 
      be&quot; at the first sign of trouble? Whether or not a marriage was 
      &quot;meant to be&quot; is beside the point; it is and therefore it 
      requires patience and protection.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passion is great outside marriage, but not so hot 
      inside it. So why do we marry? For love? Oh yes. Friendship? Certainly. 
      Children? Why not? Money? Dodgy. Fun? Never.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most young people-and a lot of older ones-marriage 
      is the first adult commitment, and if it is to succeed it must be 
      undertaken in an adult way. It isn't a bad idea for engaged couples to 
      write out the sort of contract any other working partnership would demand, 
      specifying how many children they want to have and when, where they will 
      live, how they will divide household duties, which in-laws might become 
      liabilities and what to do about th.em, how much money will be coming in, 
      as well as precisely how it will go out.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't pretend any couple would abide by such a 
      contract, but simply in drawing it up they would find out a great deal 
      about each other's unromantic expectations, for these-not sex or fidelity 
      or love -are tlne real marriage wreckers. It is alarming, for instance, 
      how many women race into a lifelong contract with a man whose income and 
      earning power they do not know. Do they still expect Daddy to find out for 
      them?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is only one way to treat any problem 
      inside marriage, sexual or otherwise, and it is the way to treat all the 
      other problems: talk to each other.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how many times has a woman written to me--a 
      complete stranger-of a deep misery that she could not tell her husband, or 
      that she failed even to catch his attention? There must arrive an egly 
      momcni between every husband and wife-maybe it's a quarrel or a 
      disappoinrment or a hurt-and if that moment drops without discussion and 
      sinks into brooding or resentment, then it will be the seed that comes in 
      the end to bear bitter fruit.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly, it is largely women who write to me and I 
      do see marriage from a woman's point of view. But in this freezing of 
      communication, I think it is often men who are the culprits. Men must talk 
      about their feelings and men must respect the validity of women's 
      feelings, or their marriages become just a way of getting their shirts 
      ironed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; When agony aunts like me talk about 
      &quot;working at a marriage&quot;, listening is what we mean. Listening is 
      hard work, especially when it is to something we would rather not hear. 
      There is no such thing as a marriage of convenience. Marriage is a 
      cumbersome, inconvenient alliance, but it. is the only way we have of 
      making families and therefore anyone who undertakes it has a 
      responsibility to it. Part of the wife's responsibility is never, never to 
      expect more from &quot;us&quot; Chan she expects from herself.<br>
