<P ALIGN=center><B>1. What Women's Lib Is about</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Women's Lib is short for the Women's Liberation Movement which got its name in America some years ago. Its supporters demand their freedom and equality with men.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In this dialogue Sheila believes in Women's Lib while Harry has his doubts.<BR>
Harry: I've never understood what this Women's Lib business is all about. I can understand women in some countries struggling for their rights. But it strikes me that here in Britain women have already got as much freedom as they could possibly want. They've got the vote, they can go to university, they can compete with men in the professions on equal terms ...<BR>
Sheila: Rubbish! You're fooling yourself. How many women members of Parliament are there? About 30 out of 635. How many women company directors? How many trade union leaders? How many judges? <BR>
Harry: Not many, I agree. But why is that? Maybe their talents don't lie in those directions. Perhaps they prefer to be housewives. <BR>
Sheila: Prefer to be housewives? You can't have any idea what it's like, when you've been married fifteen years and you've cleaned a house every day; then your husband and kids come along and mess it all up again. Can you imagine the monotony, the boredom, the frustration?<BR>
Harry: Oh yes, I can imagine it easily enough. But don't forget that a lot of men have equally boring jobs and less freedom to do them their own way. But that's beside the point; the real point is that <I>most</I> housewives, in my experience, are content to be housewives. Take my wife Jane, for example. <I>She's</I> not bored or frustrated; she finds her life quite satisfying; she cleans, cooks, gardens ...<BR>
Sheila: Oh I'm aware of that. That's because over the centuries men have <I>trained</I> and <I>educated</I> women to consider themselves inferior and to accept their position. It isn't just the men who are prejudiced against the women. The women have become prejudiced against <I>themselves.</I> They believe they really are inferior.<BR>
Harry: You mean they've been <I>conditioned</I> to accept an inferior position.<BR>
Sheila: Exactly; they've been brainwashed. It's the job of the Women's Lib movement to open their eyes to the way they have been fooled and dominated and exploited all these years.<BR>
Harry: So you want to take all these nice contented women and make them discontent and rebellious?<BR>
Sheila: Right.<BR>
Harry: I see. Well, I don't accept that the present system is the result of conditioning or brain washing at all. It's the natural biological function of a woman first to bring children into the world and then to bring them up. That is how the animals do it. In the Stone Age, when we were cavemen, the women stayed at home in the cave and the men, being stronger and braver, went out to hunt. Now the men go out and earn money instead. The Women's Lib movement denies woman her natural function. I'm not saying that woman's function is necessarily <I>inferior</I>; but I <I>am</I> saying that it's not the same.<BR>
Sheila: So if something happened in the Stone Age it was "natural" and so it would be perfectly right and proper and "natural" to go and do it now. I suppose if a man thinks he wants a woman all he has to do is go out and knock one on the head with his club and drag her home by the hair. Or maybe <T TYPE=HOT>swop</T> her with his <T TYPE=HOT>pal</T> for a couple of tiger-skins?<BR>
Harry: Don't be silly. We've grown out of that sort of barbarity.<BR>
Sheila: I should jolly well hope so too. Anyway all this Stone Age stuff is a myth made up by men. For all we know, Stone Age women were the top dogs.<BR>
Harry: All right, let's drop the Stone Age. Let's come down to the modern British family. I suppose you want to abolish it?<BR>
Sheila: No, but I want to reorganize it; I believe that the housework and the bringing up of the children should be shared equally.<BR>
Harry:  How? The husband should wash up, presumably.<BR>
Sheila: Of course. <BR>
Harry: Well, I do that at my house; and I fill up the stove and mow the lawn and dig the garden.<BR>
Sheila: Naturally. Those are men's jobs, anyway.<BR>
Harry: Oh! I didn't think you believed in men's jobs' and women's jobs'. Anyway I do quite a lot of the shopping.<BR>
Sheila: Fancy that!<BR>
Harry: And in my time I've bathed a few babies. <BR>
Sheila: And changed <T TYPE=HOT>nappies</T>?<BR>
Harry: Both changed them and washed them.<BR>
Sheila: Well, all I can say is you must be pretty unusual. My husband's never touched a nappy in his life.<BR>
Harry: I wouldn't say it was all that unusual. There are plenty of men in England who do the same as I do. Maybe that's why our wives are so satisfied. Now suppose we <I>all</I> did the same and there were enough nursery schools and so on and all the women who wanted to work could do so, what would you say to that? <BR>
Sheila: Well ...<BR>
Harry: Now suppose I was to stay at home and do all the housework and look after the children while my wife went out to work. What would you think about that?<BR>
Sheila: I'd approve of it.<BR>
Harry: And you'd be willing for her to do any job at all? <BR>
Sheila: Anything she was strong enough to do.<BR>
Harry: Good. Now some time last century a law was passed making it illegal for women to work down the coalmines. You would like that law abolished?<BR>
Sheila: Certainly.<BR>
Harry: I hope you won't want men to open doors for you and give up their seats in the bus for you.<BR>
Sheila: Of course not, as long as I'm fit.<BR>
Harry: In fact, in return for equality you would give up all these special allowances formerly made for the so-called weaker sex?<BR>
Sheila: If I'm going to be logical, yes.<BR>
Harry: Well, if women are going to be logical, that <I>will</I> be progress.<BR>
