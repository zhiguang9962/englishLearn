<P ALIGN=center><B>4. Night Life Thrives</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      In northern China people are asleep by midnight, but in Guangzhou most of the city's residents are still awake at that hour, living it up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Television and radio blast and blare away until two in the morning. Cinemas are multi-purpose. Besides showing films, they present video shows, dances and they have a bar.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I love the rich and colourful night life in this southern city," a young Beijinger said when he came to Guangzhou for a business trip. "Sometimes when I come to the city, I visit the night <T TYPE=HOT>bazaars</T> there."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I usually go shopping in the evening because I work during the day," a middle-aged woman said. "Furthermore, after supper, I like visiting the night bazaars. It's a kind of entertainment."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As most people in Guangzhou don't go to bed until far into the night, they usually eat a midnight snack. After shopping or leaving a concert, people often get a snack on the way home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I would like to spend 5 <I>yuan</I> ($1.35) to sit down and relax and eat something in the evening," Xiao Zheng, a taxi driver said. "Meanwhile, I might spend another five <I>yuan</I> to have my car washed," he added.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Guangzhou, there are car washing services near some of the big bazaars which are popular with the drivers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A lot of Guangzhou residents take a second job at night to earn extra money.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     College teachers have part-time jobs lecturing at night schools. Engineers sometimes work on a project for another corporation. College students act as tutors.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Problems also exist in the South China city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Prostitution is a bigger problem in Guangzhou than elsewhere in the country. And <T TYPE=HOT>smuggling</T> has increased recently.<BR>
