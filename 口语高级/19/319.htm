      Is it Good to Live in a Large Modern City?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I Hate to Live in a Large Modern City<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Avoid the rush-hour&quot; must be the slogan of 
      large cities the world over. If it is, it's a slogan no one takes the 
      least notice of. Twice a day, with predictable regularity, the pot boils 
      over. Wherever you look it's people, people, people. The trains which 
      leave or 'arrive every few minutes are packed: an endless procession of 
      human sardine tins. The streets are so crowded, there is hardly room to 
      move on the pavements. The queues for buses reach staggering proportions. 
      It takes a bus to get to you because the traffic on the roads has 
      virtually come to a standstill. </font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Even when a bus 
      does at last arrive, it's so f ull, it can ' t take any more passengers. 
      This whole crazy system of commuting stretches man's resources to the 
      utmost. The smallest unforeseen event can bring about conditions of utter 
      chaos. A powercut, for instance, an exceptionally heavy snowfall or a 
      minor derailment must always make city-dwellers realize how precarious the 
      balance is. The extraordinary thing is not that people put up with these 
      conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything 
      else.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Large modern cities are xoo big to control.They impose their 
      own living conditions on the people who inhabit them CIty-dwellers are 
      obliged by their environment to adopt a wholly unnatural way of life. They 
      Iose touch witla the land and rhythm of nature. It is possible to live 
      such an airconditioned existence in a large city that you are barely 
      conscious of the seasons. A few flowers in a public park (if you have the 
      time to visit it) may remind you that it is spring or summer. A few leaves 
      clinging to the pavement may remind you that it is autumn. Beyond that, 
      what is going on in nature seems totally irrelevant. All the simple, good 
      things of life like sunshine and fresh air are at a premium. Tall 
      buildings hlot out the sun. Traffic fumes pollute the atmosphere. Even the 
      distinction between day and night is lost. The flow of traffic goes on 
      unceasingly and the noise never stops.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly for 
      the &quot;privilege&quot; of living in a city. The demand for 
      accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people 
      to buy a house of their own. Exorbitant rents must be paid for tiny flats 
      which even country hens would disdain to live in. Accommodation apart, the 
      cost of living is very high. Just about everything you buy is likely to be 
      more expensive than it would be in the country.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition. to all this, city-dwellers live under 
      constant threat. The crime rate in most cities is very high. Houses are 
      burgled with alarming frequency. Cities breed crime and violence and are 
      full of places you would be afraid to visit at night. If you think about 
      it, they are not really fit to live in at all. Can anyone really doubt 
      that the country is what man was born for and where he truly belongs?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Tokyo<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't live in Tokyo. I don't even know whether I 
      would like to live there. I love it and hate it-it is one of those places 
      that you can love and hate at the same time.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first &quot;fact&quot; about Tokyo, for me, is that 
      there are too many people. I don't mean the fact that more than twelve 
      million people live there. A number like 12,000,000 doesn't mean anything 
      to me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In Tokyo there are always too many people in the places where 
      I want to be. That is the important fact for me. Of course there are too 
      many cars. The Japanese drive very fast when they can, but in Tokyo they 
      often spend a long time in traffic jams. Tokyo is not different from 
      London, Paris and New York in.that. It is different .when-one wants to. 
      walk.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At certain times of the day there are a lot of people 
      on foot in London's Oxford Street or near the big shops and stores in 
      other great cities. But the streets near the Ginza in Tokyo always have a 
      lot of people on foot, and sometimes it is really difficult to walk. 
      People are very polite; there are just too many of them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst time to be in the street is at 11.30 at 
      night. That is when the night-clubs are closing and everybody wants to go 
      home. There are 35, 000 night-clubs in Tokyo, and you do not often see one 
      that is empty. Between ll and 12 everybcdy is looking for a taxi. Usually 
      the taxis are shared by four or five people who live in the same part of 
      the city.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day, people use the trains. Perhaps the 
      first thing you notice in Tokyo is the number of trains. Most people 
      travel to and from work by train, and there is a station at almost every 
      street corner. Tokyo people buy six mi1lion train tickets every day. One 
      station--Shinjuku-has two million passengers each day. At most stations, 
      trains arrive every two or three minutes, but at certain hours there do 
      not seem eo he enough trains. At 8 o,clock in the morning you can see 
      students pushing passeng.ers into the trains. Usually the trains are 
      nearly full when they arrive at the station, so the students have to push 
      very hard. Sometimes the pushers are also pushed in by mistake, and they 
      have to get out at the next station. Some people who are pushed into the 
      train lose their shoes. They, too, get out at the next station, and go 
      back to look for them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they are usually crowded, Japanese trains are 
      very good. They always leave and arrive on time. On a I.ondon train you 
      would see everybody reading a newspaper. In Tokyo trains everybody in a 
      seat seems to be asleep. Some Japanese make a irain journey of two hours 
      to go to work, so they do their sleeping on the train. But if a train 
      journey lasis only five minutes, and if they have a seat, thcy will also 
      go to sleep. They always wake when they arrive at their station.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time I went to Tokyo, I went there from Osaka 
      in great comfort. The blue-and-white trains which run evcrv?half-hour 
      between the two cities are not only very fast but very comfortable. There 
      are no pushers; only those who have reserved seats can travel on the 
      train. It was not possible to run more trains on the old lines, so the 
      Japanese built a special linc for the new fast trains. It is a very good 
      line indeed. You can eat and drink without difficulty at 220 kilometres an 
      hour-you know the speed because there is a speedometer inside the 
      carriage.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tokyo, I stood outside the station for five minutes. 
      Three fireengines-the<br>
      very latest kind with every moclern fitting -raced past on the way to one 
      of the many fires that Tokyo has every day. The peopie who passed on foot 
      included some of the loveliest girls in the world in the latest European 
      dresses or the finest Japanese kimonos. Businessmen passed in big new 
      cars, and. among them, in a small Honda, there was a geisha in the clothes 
      and hair arrangement of hundreds of years ago. Tokyo has so many surprises 
      that none of them can really surprise me now. Instead, I am surprised at 
      myself: I must go there next week on business, and I know that I shall 
      hate the city and its twelve million people. But I feel like a man who is 
      returning to his long-lost love.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. What Kind of City Should Beijing Be?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The C. P. C. Central Committee Secretariat has proposed 
      that Beijing<br>
      should become:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) a model in public security, social order and moral 
      standards for the whole country and one of the best in the world;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) a first-rate modern city with a fine environment, 
      high standards of cleanliness and good sanitation;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) the nation's most developed city in culture, 
      science and technology, with the highest educational standard in the 
      country; and<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) a city with a thriving economy, providing its 
      residents wit.h stability<br>
      in life and all kinds of conveniences.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Duo Duo Bar, Where Many Meet<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small coffee shop on Xidan Street, barely wider than 
      a hallway, has become a haunt for many young people in downtown Beijing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Duo Duo Coffee Bar has a charm of its own. Its red 
      walls adorned with reed and bamboo hats and a spider web hanging from its 
      dark ceiling remind one of the sunsets, perhaps at lakeside in a light 
      drizzle. This is the atmosphere in which people sip a cup of coffee, tea 
      or wine while chatting with their friends.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duo Duo (Chinese for many) is owned by two yotrng men, 
      Zhang Keyu, a technician, and Lu Wei, an artist.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We started this coffee bar not only for making 
      money,&quot; said Zhang, 27, in a soft voice. &quot;We want to offer our 
      young friends a place for social contact. If what we earn is enough for 
      paying the tax, we are satisfied.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Before opening this bar, we often heId weekend 
      parties at home in which we chatted, sang and danced. Then an idea 
      occurred ta us to open a coffee shop so that we could know more people and 
      more about the society.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Without wasting any time, Lu Wei and I took out 
      all our savings to refurnish this room. Our friends did what they could to 
      help us. Lu Wei did the decoration himseif, using a lot of reed, which is 
      what his name means. Within a month, this mini-coffee room opened its door 
      to the public.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere appealed mostly to young people. A 
      university graduate, for instance, needed a place to hold a farewll party. 
      The young owners offered the bar to him free of charge and suspended their 
      business for the night. The young man invited 20 friends. And the party 
      was a great success.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Making friends is more important than making 
      money,&quot; Zhang observed. Being a full-time technician, Zhang has to 
      work in his company by day and work in his coffee bar by night. He hires 
      no employees. His friends volunteer to serve in this shop.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fashion designer whose nickname is also Duo Duo came 
      in one day. &quot;I'm glad my name is the same as this lovely bar's. I 
      wish I had as many friends as it has,?she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierre was a French student on a study tour in Beijing. 
      He enjoyed himself in the bar so much that he could not heip dancing like 
      Charlie Chaplain and blowing on the suona, a Chinese wind instrument.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Business has been good since the bar opened last 
      year, but there were minor troubles when two or three rascals said they 
      could not pay for their drinks. All we could do was ask them to write down 
      their names on our credit list. Sometimes a rude fellow would drop in and 
      talk too loudly. But the quiet atmosphere here would soon make him feel 
      out of place and he would leave. I wish I could write a novel about 
      society based on what I've seen and heard in this bar,&quot; Zhang said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was already midnight. Xidan Street was asleep and 
      empty. But the lights in Duo Duo still beckoned lonely walkers. Inside the 
      room,customers were still chatting or humming.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="? 4">&nbsp; 
      4</a>. Night Life Thrives<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in northern China people are asieep by midnight, but in 
      Guangzhou most of the city's residents are still awake at that hour, 
      living it up.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Television and radio blast and blare away until two in 
      the morning. Cinemas are multi-purpose. Besides showing films, they 
      present video shows, dances and they have a bar.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I love the rich and coloarful night life in this 
      southern city,&quot; a young Beijinger said when he came to Guangzhou for 
      a business trip. &quot;Sometimes when I come to the city, ,I visit the 
      night bazaars.there.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I usually go shopping in the evening because I 
      work during tbe day,&quot; a middle-aged woman said. &quot;Furthermore, 
      after supper,I like visiting the night bazaars. It's a.knid of 
      entertainment.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As most people in Guangzhou don't go to bed until far 
      into the night, they usually eat a midnight snack. After shopping or 
      leaving a concert, people often get a snack on the way home.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I would like to spend 5 yuan ( $1.35) to sit down 
      and relax and eat something in the evening,&quot; Xiao Zheng, a taxi 
      driver said. &quot;Meanwhile, I might .spend another five yuan to have my 
      car washed, ?he added.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Guangzhou, there are car washing services near some 
      of the big bazaars which are popular with the drivers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of Guangzhou residenis take a second job at night 
      to earn extra money.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; College teachers have part-time jobs lecturing at night 
      schools. Engineers<br>
      sometimes work on a project for another corporation. College students act 
      as tutors.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems also exist in the South China city.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prostitution is a bigger problem in Guangzhou than 
      elsewhere in the country. And smuggling has increased recently.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. Problem for Beijingers<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving public toilets has long been a .erious 
      problem in Beijing, as well as the rest of China.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a wry saying among Chinese people, 
      &quot;Follow the smell if vou want to find a toilet.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;About 80 per cent of Beijing's public toilets fit 
      the saying,&quot; admitted Xue Baoyi, an official from Beiiing Sanita tion 
      Bureau in 1989.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the we:tern gate of the chinese History Museum 
      near Tian'anmen. Square, there is an unusual &quot;luxury&quot; toilet of 
      ahout 300 square metrea, in wltich there are rockeries, fountains, fresh 
      flowers, a sofa and piped music. The standard of cleanliness is extremely 
      high.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But visitors have to pay 0.3 yuan. Some say the clean 
      toilet is worth the price, but others complain that they can not afford 
      it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Beijing there are now 40 such toilets at tourist 
      sites.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the opposite side of the museum, by the southern 
      gate of Zhongshan Park, is situated another fairly clean pay toilet. Since 
      last March, Liu Zhaomin, a retired sanitation worker from the West City 
      District Cleaning Team, and his wife have contracted to keep the facility 
      clean, and the once dirty and foul-smelling toilet has become one of the 
      cleanest in Beijing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old couple charge 0.03 yuan per person, but 
      disabled people and students are admitted free. Outside the toilet they 
      also provide water and help people take care of their belongings-all for 
      free.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their service not only earns the old couple about 800 
      yuan monthly, but it also saves the government money. The toilet fees pay 
      for maintenance<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no public toitets in some areas of the city. 
      About 200 WCs in downtown area have to have soil carried away manually, 
      mostly by old workers who are near retirement, and it is now very 
      difficult to recruit young people to do this job. Because of a shortage of 
      manpower, tools and disinfectant, it's very hard to keep those public 
      toilets clean.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;WC service in Beijing has four key 
      problems,&quot; said Xue. &quot;There are no places and money for building 
      public toilets. And most of them are in a very poor condition, and are 
      badly managed.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xue also said that the users should take care of public 
      toilets. Many newly-<br>
      painted walls in WCs are already dirty.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      6. The Countryside in Spring<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need never feel dull in the country. No matter how 
      often we walk down the same road, over the same fields, or through the 
      same woodland paths, there is always something new, somthing fresh to 
      see.It may be a little plant that has come up since last we visited the 
      place: a hedge that was just a lot of brown sticks may now be covered with 
      flowers. We may find a bird's nest deep in a bush, and, if we are careful 
      not to frighten the birds, as the days pass, see first the little eggs, 
      and then the baby birds.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never know what we may see, or find, when we start 
      out for a country walk. But we must learn to use our eyes, keep them wide 
      open, or we shall pass by many a pretty or interesting plant, or miss the 
      sight of some little wild animal, who sees us well enough, and will keep 
      perfectly still and quiet so that we should not notice him, until we are 
      quite out of sight. The wild children of the woods and fields are easily 
      frightened, and if we want to get to know them, we must do as they do, and 
      learn to be quiet and keep very still when watching them at work or play. 
      All the year round, from the first warm breath of Spring till the last icy 
      wind of Winter, we shall always find something to please and interest<br>
      us in the country.<br>
