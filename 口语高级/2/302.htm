      Are Pets Good for Mankind?<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Pets Are Good for You<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic meaning of &quot;pet&quot; is an animal we 
      keep for emotional rather than economic reasons. A pet animal is kept as a 
      companion, and we all need companions to keep us feeling happy. But pets 
      offer us more than mere companionship; they invite us to love and be 
      loved. Many owners feel their pets understand them, for animals are quick 
      to sense anger and sorrow. Often a cat or dog can comfort us at times when 
      human words don't help. We feel loved, too, by the way pets depend on us 
      for a home, for food and drink. Dogs especially, look up to their owners, 
      which makes them feel important and needed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pet can be something different to each member of the 
      family, another baby to the mother, a sister or brother to an only child, 
      a grandchild to the elderly, but for all of us pets provide pleasure and 
      companionship. It has even been suggested<br>
      that tiny pets should be sent as companions to astronauts on space ships, 
      to help reduce the stress and loneliness of space flights.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Plastic Age, when most of us live in large 
      cities, pets are particularly important for children. A pet in the family 
      keeps people in touch with the more natural, animal world. Seeing an 
      animal give birth brings understanding of the naturalness of childbirth, 
      and seeing a pet die helps a child to cope with sorrow. Learning to care 
      for a pet helps a child to grow up into a loving adult who feels 
      responsible towards those dependent on him. Rightly we teach children to 
      be good to their pets. They should learn, too, that pets are good for us 
      human beings.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. An Unmatchable Cat<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sick that winter. It was inconvenient because my 
      big room was due to be whitewashed. I was put in the little room at the 
      end of the house. The house, nearly but not quite on the top of the hill, 
      always seemed as if it might slide off into the corn fields below. This 
      tiny room had a door, always open, and windows, always open, in spite of 
      the windy cold of a July whose skies were an unending light clear blue. 
      The sky, full of sunshine; the fields, sunlit. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">But cold, very 
      cold. The cat, a bluish grey Persian, arrived purring on my bed, and 
      settled down to share my sickness, my food, my pillow, my sleep. When I 
      woke in the mornings my face turned to half-frozen sheets; the outside of 
      the fur blanket on the bed was cold; the smell of fresh whitewash from 
      next door was cold and clean; the wind lifting and laying the dust outside 
      the door was cold-but in the curve of my arm, a light purring warmth, the 
      cat, my friend.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the back of the house a wooden tub was set into the 
      earth, outside the bathroom, to catch the bathwater. No pipes carrying 
      water to taps on that farm; water was fetched by ox-drawn cart when it was 
      needed, from the well about two miles away. Through the months of the dry 
      season the only water for the garden was the dirty bathwater. The cat fell 
      into this tub when it was full of hot water.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;She 
      screamed, was pulled out into a cold wind, washed in permanganate, for the 
      tub was filthy, and held leaves and dust as well as soapy water, was dried 
      and put into my bed to warm. But she grew burning hot with fever. She had 
      pneumonia. We gave her what medicine we had in the house, but that was 
      before antibiotics, and so she died. For a week she lay in my arm purring, 
      purring,in a rough, trembling little voice that became weaker, then was 
      silent; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">licked my hand, 
      opened huge green eyes when I called her name and begged her to live; 
      closed them, died, and was thrown into the deep old well-over a hundred 
      feet deep it was-which had gone dry, because the underground water streams 
      had changed their course one year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was it. Never again. And for years I matched cats 
      in friends' houses, cats in shops, cats on farms, cats in the street, cats 
      on walls, cats in memory, with that gentle, blue-grey purring creature 
      which for me was the cat, the Cat, never to be replaced.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And besides, for some years my life did not include 
      extras, unnecessaries, ornaments. Cats had no place in an existence spent 
      always moving from place to place, room to room. A cat needs a place as 
      much as it needs a person to make its own.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it was not until twenty-five years later my life 
      had room for a cat.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Pet Dog Than to Her Young Boy<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Ann I.anders: I hope you will publish your answer 
      to this letter because there is a family out there that needs help-fast!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend (I'll call her Krista) married a nice guy in 
      1978. He's a sales rep on the read most of the time. Krista and Cal had a 
      son five years ago. A nice family unit. About a month after Junior was 
      born, Cal gave Krista a purebred beagle. She &nbsp;&nbsp; went crazy about 
      the dog and treated him better than the baby.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Junior was old enough to crawl, he began to pull 
      the dog's tail and hit him when he thought nobody was looking.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months ago, Junior began urinating in unexpected 
      and inappropriate places. First, into his mother's shoe, then in her 
      purse, next her jewel box. After he was punished for ruining the jewel 
      box, he found some scissors and cut his mother's string of pearls.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first Krista attributed the urinating to Junior's 
      laziness. I told her if it were laziness, he would just wet his pants and 
      not seek special places.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last Christmas Day, it snowed heavily. I called Krista 
      to chat. She sounded breathless. I asked her what she had been doing. 
      &quot;I've been playing outside in the snow with the dog,&quot; was her 
      reply. I asked where Junior was. She replied, &quot;Upstairs, watching 
      television, I guess.&quot; What do you see here, Ann'? Sign me-A Worried 
      Friend.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Dogs Have a Sense of Humour<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of whether dogs have a sense of humour is 
      often fiercely argued. My own opinion is that some have and some haven't. 
      Dachshunds have, but not'St Bernards or Great Danes. Apparently a dog has 
      to be small to be fond of joke. You never find a Great Dane trying to be a 
      comedian.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is fatal to let any dog know that he is funny, 
      for he immediately loses his head and starts overdoing it. As an` example 
      of this I would point to Rudolph, a dachshund I once owned, whose slogan 
      was &quot;Anything for a I.augh&quot;. Dachshunds are always the worst 
      offenders in this respect because of their peculiar shape. It is only 
      natural that when a dog finds that his mere appearance makes the viewing 
      public laugh, he should imagine that Nature intended him to be a comedian.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a cottage at t.he time outside an English 
      village,not far from a farm.where they kept ducks, and one day the farmer 
      called on me to say his ducks were disappearing and suspicion had fallen 
      on my Rudolph. Why? I asked, and he said because mine was the only dog in 
      the neighbourhood except his own Towser, and Towser had been so carefully 
      trained that he would not touch a duck if you brought it to him with 
      orange sauce over it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very annoyed. I said he only had to gaze intp 
      Rudolph's truthful brown eyes to see how baseless were his suspicions. Had 
      he not, I asked, heard of foxes? How much more likely that a fox was the 
      Bad Guy in the story. He was beginning to look doubtful and seemed about 
      to make an apology, when Rudolph, who had been listening with the greatest 
      interest and at a certain point had left the room, came trotting in with a 
      duck in his mouth.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, dachshunds overplay their sense of humour, and I 
      suppose other dogs have their faults, but they seem unimportant compared 
      with their virtues.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Man and Animal<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ancient Egypt, people believed that the cat was a 
      god. When a cat died its owners showed their sadness by the strange habit 
      of shaving their eyebrows off( More recently, in the last century in fact, 
      the famous English writer Charles Dickens had a cat who was very fond of 
      him. The cat didn't like to see Dickens working too hard. At night, when 
      the cat wanted to say &quot;Stop writingl&quot; to his master, he often 
      put out Dickens' candle with his paw!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When animals become pets, the result, after a number of 
      generations, is a smaller animal with a smaller brain. Rabbits, for 
      example, which live as pets in a garden, are much less intelligent than 
      their wild cousins. Of course, man doesn't always keep animals for 
      pleasure. Many animals have to work for their masters.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was once a farm in Namibia, Africa, which had 80 
      goats. Instead of a goatherd, there was a female baboon. She took her 
      goats to the hills every day and brought them back at night. She always 
      knew exactly which goats were hers-which is more than many humans could 
      do!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. Do Animals Communicate?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we think of communication, we normally think of 
      using words-talking face-to-face, writing messages and so on. But in fact 
      we communicate far more in other ways. Our eyes and facial expressions 
      usually tell the truth even when our words do not.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there are gestures, often unconscious: raising the 
      eyebrows, rubbing the nose, shrugging the shoulders, tapping the fingers, 
      noddin and shaking the head.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">There is also the 
      even more subtle &quot;bodylanguage&quot; language&quot;of posture: are 
      you sitting-or standing-with arms or legs crossed? Is that person standing 
      with hands in pockets, held in front of the body or hidden behind ? Even 
      the way we dress and the colours we wear communicate things to others.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, do animals communicate? Not in words, although a 
      parrot might be trained to repeat words and phrases which it doesn,t 
      understand. But, as we have learnt, there is more to communication than 
      words.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take dogs for example. They bare their teeth to warn, 
      wag their tails to welcome and stand firm, with hair erect, to challenge. 
      These signals are surely the cani ne equivalent of the human body-language 
      of facial expression, gesture and posture.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colour can be an important means of communication for 
      animals. Many birds and fish change colour, for example, to attract 
      partners during the mating season. And mating itself is commonly preceded 
      by a special dance in which both partners participate.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      6. She's All for the Birdsl<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twice a week, 58-year-old Mrs. Winifred Cass shops in 
      the market for her main supplies, &quot;topping up&quot; daily by calling 
      at local shops on her way home from work. But&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she,s not 
      buying family groceries!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She returns home laden with heavy bags of mixed hen 
      corn, pigeon corn, peanuts and large p ackets of bird food to feed her 
      larger &quot;family&quot;, the wild birds of I,eeds. And she's been doing 
      this for 16 years.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daily, she feeds the birds which frequent her garden, 
      the area around the shop where she works part-time, and several pa tches 
      of waste-ground near her home. Then, twice every week, she ioads the 
      carrying basket with bags of grain on to her tricycle and sets out to 
      pedal the 20-min!ate ride up to rthe city centre.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the morning, birds on my own roof at home hang 
      almost upsidedown trying to see me through the windows.&quot; She laughed. 
      &quot;In severe conditions last winter, I had as many as four robins in my 
      garden at the same time, though they're well known to be territorial 
      birds.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's amazing how many different kinds of birds I 
      see in the city itself . In Park Square, as well as the usual starlings, 
      pigeons and sparrows, there are blue tits, great tits, thrushes, doves, 
      and sometimes even seagulls.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started when Winifred was working at a cafe. She 
      used to throw out stale bread and buns, and developed such an interest in 
      the wild birds which accepted her offerings that she started taking food 
      along to those in City Square as well.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, an old lady sitting in the square 
      remarked that the birds could do with a more nutritious diet. So Winifred 
      began buying corn for them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the end, I was carrying so much weight and 
      tramping so far that my feet and arms really ached, ?she said. &quot;I 
      tried using wheeled shoppers, but with the weight of all that corn they 
      were breaking within weeksl So I splashed out and bought this 
      tricycle.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winifred has come across other wild-life on her 
      travels, too. &quot;I stop to feed families of hedgehogs which I found at 
      the side of the railway near the park,&quot; she said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite her love of birds, she'd never want to keep one 
      because she can't bear seeing them caged.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disaster struck recently when a car reversed into her 
      parked trike, damaging its wheels. But two local business men, hearing of 
      her activities, decided kindly to help by replacing the wheels for her.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now the &quot;Bird Woman of Leeds&quot; is back in 
      action again, doing the job she loves best-caring for the host of 
      feathered friends who have come to rely on her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      7. Too Many Pets in France<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In France a campaign has been launched to warn against 
      the danger of a threatening over-population . . . of petsl The country is 
      the second most densely populated country in the world as far as domestic 
      animals are concerned. At the moment it is inhabited by more than 8% 
      million dogs and almost as many cats. Every second family in Paris owns 
      one or more pets, which cause problems of hygiene that cannot be solved. 
      In the year 2000 France will have more than 15 million dogs if no drastic 
      measures are taken to stop this increase.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French organization for the protection of animals 
      has appealed to the owners to have their dogs and cats of both sexes 
      sterilized, because the animals themselves are in danger of becoming the 
      first victims. Every summer, when the holiday-exodus begins, thousands of 
      dogs and cats are abandoned, because their owners, unable to take them 
      along, do not want to or cannot find homes where their pets will be looked 
      after during their absence. Only one of three of these stray animals can 
      be adopted, the other two must be killed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great number of pet-owners, however, object to 
      sterilization on grounds of &quot;inadmissable cruelty&quot;.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      8. Pets Eat Better Than Peoplel<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My mouth watered as I imagined the lovely soup I 
      could make from some bones in the butcher's window. There was a lot of 
      meat on them, too. So I went in and bought some. `Certainly, one pound of 
      bones for your dog, madam,' said the butcher brightly. My next stop was at 
      the fish shop, where I asked for some cheap fish. 'For your cat?, asked 
      the assistant. As you may have guessed, neither bones nor fish were for 
      pets-they were for me, a pensioner. But it made me think that many animals 
      eat better meals than peoplel&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      9. A Birthday Present for a Dog!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We have a friend who works in a Dog Parlour where 
      they sell coats for dogs. A customer, choosing a coat, tried to describe 
      her dog and the saleswoman suggested she bring the dog in so that they 
      could fit him. Horrified, the customer replied that she couldn't do that 
      as it was for the dog's birthday present and she didn't want him to see 
      it! &quot;<br>
