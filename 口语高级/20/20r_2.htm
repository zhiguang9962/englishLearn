<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Why Is Housing Reform Necessary?</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     During the past few years, the State has spent 30 billion <I>yuan</I> a year on building and maintaining houses and subsidizing rents. But as the investment produces little financial return and funds are tight, housing shortages still persist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     According to calculations by the Leading Group of Housing Reform under the State Council, if only one half of the State-built houses nationwide are sold to urban residents, up to 200 billion <I>yuan</I> will be <T TYPE=HOT>recouped</T>, which can be further used as investments to construct more residential dwellings or help the development of other industries.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In this way, the abnormal circle of more house construction and heavier burdens for the State to shoulder will be resolved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Successful housing reform will have other beneficial effects on the society.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     People buying their own houses will restrain the swelling of consuming funds and tighten the State's grip on any panic buying.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     And last but not least, commercialization of housing would stop the practice adopted by some officials of abusing their position to obtain extra or larger houses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     However, the nationwide situation of housing reform is still rather critical. Last year, the government forecast of 80 cities mapping out their scenarios of housing reform was not reached.<BR>
