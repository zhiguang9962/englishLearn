      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Housing Reform Faces Obstacles<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing reform, acknowledged by economists and 
      politicians at home and abroad as central to China's economic reform, has 
      reached a critical stage.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent article in the overseas edition of the 
      magazine Outlook remarked that China's housing reform is facing five 
      obstacles. Major breakthroughs will surely come if these knotty problems 
      are carefully and properly handled.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the old attitudes of the bulk of urban 
      employees that it is the State's duty to provide shelter as a kind of 
      social welfare has adversely affected their enthusiasm for participating 
      in housing reform.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people don't include housing on their shopping 
      list. They think that they deserve State housing no matter how little they 
      may have contributed towards it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of them consider commercialization or 
      privatization of housing as being synonymous with taking money out of 
      people's pockets and so running counter to the ideals of socialism.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the little money that workers, enterprises 
      and governments at all levels have has affected the accomplishment of 
      housing expectations.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The per-capita monthly earnings of not more than 80 
      yuan in China's urban areas plus the continuous price hike of recent years 
      has greatly lowered the citizens' ability to pay extra to buy a house and 
      has reduced their incentive.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult for enterprises to earmark large sums 
      to support housing reform since many of them are not profitably run. The 
      State, already in deficit, finds itself unable to subsidize the reform.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the current housing reform will encounter 
      social risks since those vested interest holders, most of them senior 
      cadres, stand in the way of the restructure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, the rocketing price of housing has 
      tremendously dampened the enthusiasm of potential house buyer. In some 
      large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, the price has surged to record 
      heights of around 2,000 yuan a square metre.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the overall social reform environment has 
      slowed the pace of housing reform. The present relationship of cost, 
      wages, finance and social welfare system reforms has stemmed the housing 
      reform since they are closely integrated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the preceding problems, the article puts 
      forward several suggestions on how to resolve them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, there should be more publicity to 
      encourage urban dwellers to give up their stereotype thinking that housing 
      is social welfare right guaranteed by the State.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercialization of housing may be achieved through 
      several different phases.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of carrying out the housing reform at one 
      stroke should be abandoned.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing reform should be implemented in conformity with 
      the country's wage, price and other related reforms. The State Council 
      should pressure local governments--especially those that are dragging 
      their feet - to speed up their housing reform when necessary, but meantime 
      it should promise to share sorne of the risks local authorities will face.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So quite a few obstacles have emerged and the decision 
      makers should do some hard thinking to determine the correct course of 
      action.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were the opinions aired by dozens of experts and 
      economists on construction and housing reform who have been summoned 
      recently to a meeting in Beijing by the Ministry of Construction, to 
      coincide with the World Habitat Day on October 2.<br>

      1. Encouraging Atmosphere for Housing Reform<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current atmosphere in respect of reform in housing 
      is still encouraging, the experts and economists said. Despite some areas 
      and departments having resorted. to the attitude of 
      &quot;wait-and-see&quot; and even called a halt to housing reform, 
      attributable to the April-June social unrest, 2G out of the country's 30 
      provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions are still maintaining 
      their endeavours adhering to the scheduled restructure.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out in the main metropolises, Beijing and Tianjin are 
      experimenting with a reform scenario of &quot;multiple directions&quot;, 
      such as raising rents for public residential housing, encouraging urban 
      residents to buy more State-built housing, arranging funds to build 
      commercial high-rises, setting up housing deposit banks and the like.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanghai, the largest city in China, is also drafting 
      its blueprint to quicken the pace of its housing reform in keeping up with 
      their housing requirements.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, an 
      overall housing reform plan is beginning this month. The municipal 
      government plan stipulates that all residents living in 
      non-privately-owned houses, including those owned by the city's real 
      estate administration departments and by State and collective units, will 
      have to purchase their dwellings or rent them at a rate set by the 
      government.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The housing reform characterized by selling of housing 
      and raising rents will be enormously conducive to the healthy development 
      of China's economy in all sectors, some economists maintain.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Why Is Housing Reform Necessary?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the past few years, the State has spent 30 
      billion yuan a year on building and maintaining houses and subsidizing 
      rents. But as the investment produces little financial return and funds 
      are tight, housing shortages still persist.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to calculations by the Leading Group of 
      Housing Reform under the State Council, if only one half of the 
      State-built houses nationwide are sold to urban residents, up to 200 
      billion yuan will be recouped, which can be further used as investments.to 
      construct more residential dwellings or help the development of other 
      industries.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the abnormal circle of more house 
      construction and heavier burdens for the State to shoulder will be 
      resolved.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successful housing reform will have other beneficial 
      effects on the society.<br>
      People buying their own houses will restrain the swelling of consuming 
      funds and tighten the State,s grip on any panic buying.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last but not least, commercialization of housing 
      would stop the practice adopted by some officials of abusing their 
      position to obtain extra or larger houses.<br>
      However, the nationwide situation of housing reform is still rather 
      critical. Last year, the government forecast of 80 cities mapping out 
      their scenarios of housing reform was not reached.</font></p>

      3. Tianjin Folks Can Buy Their Own Houses<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A double blessing descended upon Wang Jianpo, a worker 
      at the Tianjin Machine Tool Plant, last month.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He married a beautiful young girl and bought a two-room 
      flat--a thing considered by many Chinese young men even harder than 
      finding a wife.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the wedding ceremony, which took place in the new 
      flat recently, Wang and his wife presented some wedding candies to the 
      city leaders to express their gratitude for the government's efforts to 
      build more housing for sale for local residents.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young couple is one of the 20, 000 households who 
      moved into new houses built at their own expense last month.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The State covered the expenses for infrastructures such 
      as roads linking all the apartment blocks, waterworks and sewers. Nearby 
      industrial enterprises financed construction of grain shops, groceries and 
      parks.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction costs were shared by the local government, 
      would-be buyers and most local enterprises.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The method is a good way to speed up urban 
      housing construction and tallies with the current consumption level of 
      Chinese urbanites,&quot;said a local government official.<br>
      There is no doubt that money collected from house sales will greatly 
      relieve the shortage of funds for new construction, the official added.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Housing Reform in Tianjin<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, China practised. a housing system 
      under which work units were held responsible for housing their employees, 
      who paid a nominal rent. Therefore, houses were regarded as State-funded 
      welfare facilities rather than commodities.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tianjin is one of the 1? pilot cities chosen by the 
      State Council to try out the practice of selling government-built 
      apartments to individuals as part of the country's housing reform. The aim 
      is to recover part of the construction cost for reinvestment in housing 
      construction.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city I;as built houses for sale with a total floor 
      space of 20 million<br>
      square metres over the past decade. This has helped raise the per capita 
      living space of urban residents in the city to 6.4 square metres, double 
      that of a decade ago.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year the city has built dwellings for sale 
      totalling 500,000 square metres. Local residents raised 100 million yuan, 
      the government invested 25 million yuan and local enterprises provided 75 
      million yuan to cover the cost of construction.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of every square metre averaged 300 yuan. The 
      buyers pay 200 yuan for each square metre and the State covers the rest.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Tianjin resi.dents are saving money and waiting 
      for their turn to purchase new houses instead of spending more money on 
      consumer durables, such as colour TV sets, refrigerators and 
      video-recorders, as in the past.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many experts, officials and local residents have called 
      for an extension of the &quot;tripartite cooperation&quot; in housing 
      construction- financing by means of individual- raised funds with the help 
      of the government and enterprises. This is because wholesale 
      commercialization of housing won't work yet, as only a few people can 
      afford to buy houses.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The housing cooperatives have turned out to be a 
      feasible way to get over the impasse. People are more keen to.invest in 
      their own houses and the State has less of a financial burden.<br>
