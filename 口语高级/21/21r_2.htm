&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ancient Chinese reformers advocated selecting all talented people to be officials regardless of their family backgrounds. This practice is still significant, for it opposed appointing people by favouritism.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But it is improper for us to think that the talented can only become officials, otherwise they are <T TYPE=HOT>stifled</T>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In the course of the current reform, China needs talented personnel in all trades. It is justifiable that talented personnel bring their ability into full play by becoming leaders.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But the point is who can be considered talented? Some see the holders of senior professional titles are talented; some think of those who have college diplomas as talented; some say that they are those who have made inventions or outstanding contributions to society.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There would not be enough vacancies if all of these people were to become officials.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is unnecessary for all the talented to elbow their way into <T TYPE=HOT>officialdom.</T> They can strive to become experts in philosophy, science, literature, art, history and education. There is never a limit to the number of experts in these fields.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Albert Einstein was once invited by Israel to become its president. It was considered a matter of course for Einstein to accept the invitation. But Einstein refused it bluntly and continued his physics study.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I do not mean that talented people should not become officials at all. But what I want to specify is that different people have different strengths, and that not everyone is capable of becoming an official. If people without leadership capacity are chosen as officials, they can only bungle things.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Before Hou Yuzhu and Zheng Meizhu, two aces of the Chinese National Women's Volleyball Team, retired, they were asked by reporters if the government would assign them jobs in a leading body, just as it had done for some of their former teammates.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Hou and Zheng, who shared the credit for the team becoming world champions, responded that they did not want to become officials, and that they wanted to study the knowledge and skills needed in society to keep <T TYPE=HOT>abreast</T> of its development.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Their decision may be of some help to us.<BR>
