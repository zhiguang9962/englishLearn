      Flattering the Boss Gets You Everywhere<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world of work, flattery will get you everywhere.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees who flatter their bosses tend to receive 
      better<br>
      evaluations and move more easily up the corporate ladder-whether they 
      deserve to or not--said Gerald Ferris, management professor at Texas A and 
      M University.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Based on what we have found, it looks to be the 
      case that political skills are highly reinforced out there in the work 
      place. It is the politically astute that are more often promoted,&quot; 
      Ferris said in an interview.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His conclusions are based on surveys of employees and 
      supervisors takeri as part of his research into political behaviour in the 
      office.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;People tend to believe that flattery is just too 
      transparent to be effective, but we have found that is not necessarily 
      true. We have found a strong correlation between this type of behaviour 
      and good evaluations,&quot; Ferris said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons that flattery works are many, Ferris said, 
      but most apparently have to do either with the boss's ego, or insecurity, 
      or both.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some supervisors enjoy having their egos boosted by 
      complimentary employees, while others simply need the reinforcement of 
      consent, he said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What we have found is that often bosses are new 
      or unsure of themselves and need a lot of social reinforcement for their 
      decisions. They might look at flattery as a sign that they are right, 
      &quot; Ferris said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons employees flatter bosses vary, too, Ferris 
      said. Ambition - the desire to move up the corporate ladder --is often 
      behind the compiiments, he said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, many workers use flattery to obscure their 
      laziness or incompetence.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We did find a big gap between some of the people 
      doing this manipulation and those that did not. Many of these people (fla.ttering 
      the boss) were not the high performers. They were doing it to cover up 
      their shortcomings,&quot; he said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if flatterers are not always top workers, they 
      frequently are what social scientists call &quot;high self-monitors&quot;, 
      Ferris said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Those are people who are highly attuned to and 
      aware of their surroundings and know what to do to get a favourable 
      response,&quot; he said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fellow employees are not blind to what their colleagues 
      are doing, Ferr'ss said. But, while they may disapprove, they usually do 
      not tell the boss for fear of appearing jealous, he said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flattery works best when the employee is saying 
      something he or she really means, Ferris said. But sincere or not, it 
      should be done in moderation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If you overdo it or if you are not sincere and 
      the boss catches on, it can mean trouble, &quot; he said. &quot;You have 
      to be subtle and not take it too far. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way employees can avoid appearing too flattering is 
      to occasionally disagree with the boss on minor points, he said. In that 
      way, the employee avoids being viewed as a &quot;yes-man&quot;.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. People Should Be Rewarded according to Ability,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Not according to Age and Experienc<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young men and women today are finding it more and more 
      necessary to protest against what is known as the 
      &quot;Establishment&quot;: that is, the people who wield power in our 
      society. Clashes with the authorities are reported almost daily in the 
      press. The tension that exists between old and young could certainly be 
      lessened if some of the most obvious causes were removed. In particular, 
      the Establishment should adopt different attitudes to work and the rewards 
      it brings. Today's young people are ambitious.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;Many are 
      equipped with a good education and are understandably impatient to succeed 
      as quickly as possible. They want to be able to have their share of the 
      good things in life while they are still young enough to enjoy them. The 
      Establishment, however, has traditionaly believed that people should be 
      rewarded according to iheir age and experience. Ability counts for less. 
      As the Establishment controls the purse-strings, its views are inevitably 
      imposed on society. Employers pay the smallest sum consistent with keeping 
      you in a job. You join the hierarchy and take your place in the queue. If 
      you are young, you go to the very end of the queue and stay there no 
      matter how brilliant you are.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;What you 
      know is much less important than whom you know and how old you are. If you 
      are able, youf abilities will be acknowledged and rewarded in due course, 
      that is, after twentj?or thirty years have passed. By that time you will 
      be considered old enough to join the Establishment and you will be 
      expected to adopt its ideals. God help you if you don't.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to be a gigantic conspiracy against young 
      people. While on the one hand society provides them with better 
      educational facilities, on the other it does its best to exclude them from 
      the jobs that really matter. There are exceptions, of course. Some young 
      people do manage to break through the barrier despite the restrictions, 
      but the great majority have to wait patiently for years before they can 
      really give full rein to their abilities. This means that, in most fields, 
      the views of young people are never heard because there is no one to 
      represent them. All important decisions about how society is to be run are 
      made by people who are too old to remember what it was like to be young.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resentment is the cause of a great deal of bitterness. 
      The young resent the old because they feel deprived of the good things 
      life has to offer. The old resent the young because they are afraid of 
      losing what they have. A man of fifty or so might say, &quot;Why should a 
      young rascal straight out of school earn more than I do?&quot; But if the 
      young rascal is more able, more determined, harder-working than his 
      middle-aged critic, why shoutdn't he? Employers should recognize ability 
      and reward it justly. This would remove one of the biggest causes of 
      friction between old and young and ultimatley it would lead to a better 
      society.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Officialdom<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient Chinese reformers advocated selecting aiI 
      talented people to be officiais regardiess of their #amily backgrounds. 
      This practice is stiil significant, for it opposed appointing people by 
      favouritism.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is improper for us to think that the talented 
      can only become officials, otherwise they are stifled.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the current reform, China needs 
      talented personnel in all trades. It is justifiable that talented 
      personnei bring their ability into full play by becoming leaders.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the point is who can be considered talented? Some 
      see the holders of senior professional titles are talented: some think of 
      those who have college diplomas as taltented; some say that they are those 
      who have made inventions or outstanding contributions to society.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would not be enough vacancies if all of these 
      people were to become officials.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unnecessary for all the talented to elbow their 
      way into officialdom. They can strive to become experts in philosophy, 
      science, literatore, art, history and education. There is never a limit to 
      the number of experts in these fields.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert Einstein was once invited by Israei to become 
      its president. It was eonsidered a matter of course for Einstein to accept 
      the invitation. But Einstein refused it bluntly and continued his physics 
      study.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not mean that talented people should not become 
      officials at aII. But what I want to specify is that different people have 
      different strengths, and that not everyone is capable of becoming an 
      official. If people without leadership capacity are chosen as officials, 
      they can only bungle things.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Hou Yuzhu and Zheng Meizhu, two aces af the 
      Chinese National Women's Volleyball Team, retired, they were asked by 
      reporters if the government would assign them jobs in a leading body, just 
      as it had done for some of their former teammates.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hou and Zheng, who shared the credit for the team 
      becoming world champions, responded that they did not want to become 
      officials, and that they wanted to study the knowledge and skills needed 
      in society to keep abreast of its development.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their decision may be of some help to us.</font></p>

      3. You Can Get Promoted Half a Grade if You Are<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Willing to Say:&quot;Yes Sir, No Sir!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unhappy victim of the consumer society is Mr.Batia, 
      a fifty-two-year-old Indian journalist working in broadcasting. For him, 
      however, the misery. is caused less by the nature of his work than by the 
      competitive atmosphere which surrounds it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Mr. Batia: &quot; I' m not interested in my job. I'm not being treated 
      properly and there are many injustices. I just do honest work, but I do as 
      little as I can. The atmosphere is very polluted. You can get promoted 
      half a grade if you're willing to say: 'Yes sir, no sir!' I've been there 
      twenty-three years, and I hate the whole mentality of the place. They 
      treat me like a colonial. Tbey think I live in the colonies, but I've done 
      things in jurnalism that have never been done before. I have a colleague 
      who is half a grade up and when the boss is away he's supposed to 
      officiate. I've had rows with him: I have a hot temper. I said to him: 'Lood, 
      don't you try to boss me or one of us will end up on the floor. I've met 
      good Englishmen and bad Englishmen, and you' re the worst Englishman I've 
      ever met.'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm honest and outspoken and people don't like 
      me. Nobody likes me. If.you are a crook you can get on well.&quot;<br>
