<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Murderers Must Be Hanged</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Murderers are cruel sadistic monsters. They must be hanged. What they do puts them beyond the pale of humanity. They are not humans and therefore they cannot expect to be treated as humans. They must be made to see the error of their ways, and the only way of doing that is by hanging them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     British justice is the finest in the world, but by not imposing the death sentence people will think we are failing to punish crime justly. It is the principle of justice itself that is at stake. How can we claim to be a just nation if people who murder are not themselves executed? An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the very basis of justice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Some people claim that hanging is cruel, but it is more humane than the other penalties at present imposed. It is quick, and thanks to modern methods, painless. It is only the <T TYPE=HOT>agitators</T> who campaign against the death penalty who say it is cruel. The reality is that it is a kindness to the murderer. Far better to be hanged than to suffer the slow torture of life imprisonment which is in any case a burden on the long-suffering taxpayer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There are other objections to life imprisonment. There is the chance that the murderer may escape. He or she would then be free to murder again. Nor is life imprisonment what it says. It is only a <T TYPE=HOT>nominal</T> sentence. In no time at all the murderer will be released. How can the ordinary person feel safe knowing that there are murderers on the prowl seeking their next victim?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The <T TYPE=HOT>crux</T> of the matter is that only hanging acts as a <T TYPE=HOT>deterrent</T> to murderers. In the past, many a would-be murderer must have refrained from committing this <T TYPE=HOT>heinous</T> crime knowing that such an act would result in certain execution. Put yourself in his or her shoes. You would not commit murder knowing that the penalty for so doing was death. It is the same with murderers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     So-called liberals point to the experience of other European countries where the death penalty has ceased to exist. But what happens in those countries is no guide to what may happen here. It is our safety that is at risk, not theirs. Only the return of the death penalty can ensure that we can sleep safely in our beds.<BR>
