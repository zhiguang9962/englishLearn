<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Mediation System Helps Deter Crimes</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ye Chengmei of Guojiahe Town, Xinzheng County in central China's Henan Province, was beaten by her husband Pan Chenggong over a trifling matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ye's brother mobilized 14 young men with wooden sticks and spades to teach his brother-in-law a lesson. Hearing the news, Pan Chenggong organized more than 20 young men to fight back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     At this critical moment, 59-year-old Ye Bingyan, a mediator, appeared and persuaded the men to stop the fight and sit down to talk. Under the mediator's persuasion and his discussion of the law, Pan admitted his wrongdoings and went to the home of his wife's parents to make an apology.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     This is one example of China's people's mediation system which has become a major method of settling civil disputes concerning marriage, family relations, housing, money and property issues.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     China now has more than 1 million mediation committees with over 6 million mediators. From 1982 to 1988, they settled 50 million civil issues, up to 10 times the number of cases went to court.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Henan Province alone, more than 287,000 mediators from 53,642 people's mediation committees have dealt with 5,723,657 cases, preventing losses for 51,343 people.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The mediators enjoy popular support and respect as they report the views, complaints and wishes of the <T TYPE=HOT>populace</T> to <T TYPE=HOT>grassroots governments</T> and pass along the government principles, policies, laws and regulations to the masses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The villagers speak highly of Ye Bingyan's work. They say wherever and whenever disputes happen, Ye will be there. He has prevented 15 gang fights, saved the lives of 14 people threatened with homicide or suicide and also helped five couples reunite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ye said the key to his work is concern and love for others.<BR>
