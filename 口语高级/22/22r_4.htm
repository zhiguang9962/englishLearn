<P ALIGN=center><B>4. Why Was She Set Free?</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     An armed robber walked free from the Old Bailey after a kind-hearted judge heard how a nightmare attack she endured in London had turned her to crime.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Rachel Farrington, of Maypole Road, Sheepbridge, Huddersfield, was only 16 when she left Yorkshire and went to London with her boyfriend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A year later she was threatening to shoot a gang of drug dealers while her accomplice, a hardened criminal, tied them up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The 19-year-old pleaded guilty to robbery, having an imitation <T TYPE=HOT>firearm</T> and aggravated burglary on July 5, 1986, but the judge deferred sentencing for six months and told her to go home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I had intended to impose a sentence of two years in prison," said Recorder James Crespi, QC. "Your co-defendant was lucky to get only six years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "But I am reluctant to send you to prison. You were extremely young. You came to London and got involved with drug dealers. Go back to Yorkshire. Try to get a job and lead a sensible life."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The judge was told that Rachel found herself involved in London's drugs underworld soon after she arrived.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     She met "a man involved with drugs" who became her new boyfriend, said her defence counsel, Mr. Stephen Leslie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Within a month the relationship had turned ugly and she finally left after a horrifying attack.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "She bore a grudge, but because of things that had happened earlier she did not report it to police," said Mr. Leslie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Rachel found a new friend, Garnet Gibson, who proved equally dangerous. He was ten years older than her and had been in prison many times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When she told him what she had endured in the attack by her ex-boyfriend and his associates, Gibson told she could get her revenge and Rachel agreed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Except for the grudge this was completely out of character and she was completely out of her depth," said Mr. Leslie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The couple burst into a flat in North London, where Gibson, armed with an air-pistol, ordered Rachel to tie up the three men found inside.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But the inexperienced girl did such a poor job of it that Gibson handed her the gun while he tied up the men.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The victims soon realized Rachel was helpless despite her threats to shoot them and they fought back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     She was brushed aside by one man and finally she just walked out of the flat and threw the gun away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Gibson was soon overpowered by the men and police were called in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Rachel admitted everything to police and was <T TYPE=HOT>bailed</T>, but she fled to Portugal and did not return until a month after Gibson's trial. He was jailed for six years in July last year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Rachel was rearrested as she entered Britain. Her mother had sent her the fare home so that she could return for medical treatment for a cyst.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The court heard that Rachel was one of nine children and was from an "excellent" family.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Her mother, Mrs. Mary Farrington, told the judge that her daughter had got out of hand after her father died of cancer and Rachel lost her job through illness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     She said: "I have a home for her and the family is willing to help her in any way we can."<BR>
