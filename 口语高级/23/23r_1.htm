<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Breaking the "Iron Rice Bowl"</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In his effort to repair the damage of 30 lost years, Deng Xiaoping is abolishing what is called the "iron rice bowl" or "big-pot system", which guaranteed that workers and peasants shared equal rewards regardless of their contribution. In its place, he has introduced "production responsibility", which links <T TYPE=HOT>remuneration</T> to individual effort.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The dramatic impact of these reforms is most evident in rural China, home to more than 80 percent of the country's 1.1 billion people. A visit to a township outside Wuxi tells the story. The commune there, like most throughout China, has been <T TYPE=HOT>dismantled</T>. Instead of being assigned to jobs by a team leader and drawing equal shares from a common revenue pool as in the past, the peasants contract to work a piece of land and to deliver a quota of products to the state at a fixed price.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     What they produce above the quota they may keep for their own consumption or sell in a free market. They also are encouraged to cultivate bigger private plots and to engage in what are known as "sideline activities" to augment their incomes. The result is that the average household income has increased from about $225 a year to $350 ¡ª $400. The most enterprising can earn many times that sum.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      <T TYPE=HOT>Lauded</T> in the Chinese press as a model for all to follow is the chicken farmer who went into the egg business and amassed a fortune sufficient to enable her to buy China's first privately owned car, as well as two trucks for her enterprise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Everywhere the evidence of rising affluence ¡ª in Chinese terms ¡ª is visible. In one town I visited, where hardly a new house had been built for 30 years, nearly 90 percent of the families have now moved into new accommodations. Most homes have radio-cassette players, and a majority have television sets acquired in the past year or so. Less than five years ago, such luxuries were unavailable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Nanjing, once the capital of the Kuomintang government, a visitor sees another aspect of the personal incentive system. Business booms in a free market of hundreds of individually operated stalls lining several narrow streets. On sale are vegetables, fruits, chickens and live fish and <T TYPE=HOT>eels</T>. Buyers are many. Peasant merchants charge what the market will bear and keep what money they get.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Are Communist leaders worried that all of this will lead to the emergence of a new class of rich peasants? They insist they are not. "Some peasants prosper early, others will prosper later," says one official. Deng puts it as a trickle-down theory: "Make some people rich first so as to lead all people to wealth."<BR>
