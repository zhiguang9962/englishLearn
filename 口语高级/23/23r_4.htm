<P ALIGN=center><B>4. A Traveling Man's Labour of Love</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese calender, Wang Haihe, 22, is considered by some people as having some of the characteristics of monkeys, such as being lively, <T TYPE=HOT>nimble</T> and good at climbing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wang himself doesn't deny this, since he really can't stand a tranquil and unchanging life. He has been busy moving about since his childhood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Now, only a few years later, he has parlayed his energy and interests into a thriving travel business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As early as when he was in primary school, he and his family spent most of their holidays travelling to nearby mountain areas or to scenic spots in Jiangxian County, Shanxi Province.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Travelling has sometimes meant risk to me, and several times I was on the verge of death when I climbed onto overhanging cliffs," said Wang. "But this never stops me; in fact, it excites me."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     By the time when Wang graduated from high school, he had set foot on such famous mountains around the country as Taishan in Shandong Province, Huashan in Shanxi, Hengshan in Hebei and Songshan in Henan. Of all the places he has been, he likes Mt. Huashan best. It is considered one of the most precipitous and dramatic mountains in the country.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I was there nine times," he said. "Each time I reached the summit, I shouted with excitement."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But things went contrary to Wang's interests. He got a job in the local Finance Bureau and worked as a clerk after he graduated from high school.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "From some people's point of view it is a good job, since it is easy, comfortable and safe, but for me it is intolerable," said Wang.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     After a few months, Wang quit his job, giving up the "iron rice bowl" of security, and on October 1 last year he opened a privately-owned travel service, the first one in the province. It aims at arousing people's interest in travel and helps them arrange tours, lodging, transportation, photo-taking, entrance tickets and so on.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     From information he had collected from newspapers and magazines, he learned that about 100,000 people in the country every year come to visit the Guandi Temple, the most convenient scenic spot from Jiangxian County.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "But very few people from the county came to the place, not because they had been there, but because most people here had no idea about travelling," said Wang. "Most of the youngsters here would think it is a waste of money to travel and they spend most of their money on food and clothes."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wang put advertisements along streets to draw the interest of young people.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "From the time I was very young, I dreamed of touring the country's beautiful rivers and mountains," he said. "When I am out in nature, I always feel relaxed and become open-minded. Now that I have benefited a lot from travelling, I want more people to share my feeling, and do my best to help them and make their travel easier and more interesting."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     After being in business only a week, Wang organized his first group of youths ¡ª 17 of them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "The trip is exciting and really economical," said one of the youngsters in the group. "We traveled to Mt. Huashan and Xi'an in Shaanxi Province for three days, and each of us only spent 65 <I>yuan</I> altogether."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     With good knowledge about the legends and historical information about various sites, and having rich experience in arranging trips, Wang soon won the trust of the local people. To his great satisfaction, more and more people in the county have begun to show an interest in travelling, and Wang's travel service has become very popular among young people there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I am very happy with my work now. To me, the¡®iron rice bowl' is actually an iron lock. I would rather live according to my own desires and realize my full potential," he said.<BR>
