<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Since 1987, reform of the Chinese labour system has stepped out of the laboratory and into the real world of employment.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For many, the "iron rice bowl" no longer exists.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The "iron rice bowls" ！ a Chinese euphemism for government-assigned secure jobs that had been cherished for more than 30 years ！ were shattered.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> No accurate figure was available on how many workers have been laid off so far.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But scattered reports offer a glimpse of the scope of unemployment.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In 1987, State-owned enterprises in Hubei Province laid off 14000 workers.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Last summer, 30000 people in Shanghai were receiving unemployment pensions.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The inauguration of a labour market at the Shenyang Steel Pipes Factory in Liaoning Province went unheralded ！ no firecrackers, no marching band, no bursts of applause.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Instead of gaiety, weeping was heard at the perimeter of a small crowd of about 50 people witnessing the event.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Except for a few officials sitting at tables on the platform, everyone at the meeting had been laid off at the end of a work-optimization programme.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They included labourers, cadres, technicians, Communist Party members, and even university graduates.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The saddest were the eight ex-cadres who lost their executive jobs.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Zhao Yusheng, 46, was Party secretary of the No 2 workshop of the factory before he was laid off.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He found another job on the labour market, loading and unloading trucks.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He once served in the army and participated in battles.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But this turn of events made him cry.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "For more than 20 years I had been doing what the Party asked me to do," he said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Now on the labour market I find I do not have any skills.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I can only become a truck loader."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For more than 30 years, unemployment in China has been regarded as an evil which labour planners have tried to avoid at all costs.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The planners were once quite complacent about the solution ！ the "iron rice bowl".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were confident that a policy of "low salaries and broad employment" would end unemployment in China forever.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But the "iron rice bowl" system was a dead-end.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Reluctantly, the planners looked for another way.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And even though it would cause pain and difficulties, they recommended a system that would permit laying off incompetent staff.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That, they felt, would increase efficiency and give ailing enterprises a new lease on life.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For workers affected, lay-off is a bitter pill which some simply cannot swallow.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For more than 30 years, Chinese people have felt totally secure in their jobs.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now they are facing the possibility of losing their jobs, and many have reacted with panic and horror.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Fu Gangzhan, director of the Economic Development Research Institute of the East China University of Chemistry, has studied China's labour problems for many years.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Two summers ago Fu and his colleagues conducted a survey of several thousand workers and entrepreneurs in Shanghai.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Their purpose was to unveil the reality of unemployment in China.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> During the same period, economics professor Tao Zhaipu of the Zhongshan University in Guangzhou was also studying the employment actualities in China.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They came to the same conclusion almost at the same time: unemployment exists and has always existed in China.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They found that there was a core of unemployed numbering between 15 million to 25 million people in the country.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This range is almost the same as the entire populations of Australia and Canada.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Unlike unemployment in developed countries, unemployment in China is generally hidden from view.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The State spends 50 to 60 billion yuan ($16.5 to $18.9 billion)</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> each year in the form of salaries, bonuses and other benefits supporting "iron rice bowl" workers who never actually earn a penny for their employers.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This expenditure accounts for about 50 per cent of the profits handed over to the State by all the enterprises in the country.</T>
