      Is It Necessary to Keep the &quot;Iron Rice Bowl&quot;?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Living Without the &quot;Iron Rice Bowl&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1987, reform of the Chinese labour system has 
      stepped out of the laboratory and into the real world of employment. For 
      many, the &quot; iron rice bowl &quot; no longer exlsts. The &quot; iron 
      rice bowls &quot; - a Chinese euphemism for government-assigned secure 
      jobs that had been cherished for more than 30 years - were shattered.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No accurate figure was available on how many workers 
      have been laid off so far. But scattered reports offer a glimpse of the 
      scope of unemployment.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1987, State-owned enterprises in Hubei Province laid 
      off 14, 000 workers. Last summer, 30, 000 people in Shanghai were 
      receiving unemployment pensions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inauguration of a labour market at the Shenyang 
      Steel Pipes Factory in Liaoning Province went unheraldedno firecrackers, 
      no marching band, no bursts of applause. Instead of gaiety, weeping was 
      heard at the perimeter of a small crowd of about 50 people witnessing the 
      event.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for a few officials sitting at tables on the 
      platform, everyone at the meeting had been laid off at the end of a 
      work.optimization programme. They included labourers, cadres, technicians, 
      Communist Party members, and even university graduates. The saddest were 
      the eight ex-cadres who lost their executive jobs.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhao yusheng, 46, was Party secretary of the No 2 
      workshop of the factory before he was laid off. He found another job on 
      the labour market, loading and unloading trucks. He once served in the 
      army and participated in battles. But this turn of events made him cry.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For more than 20 years I had been doing what the 
      Party asked me to do, &quot; he said. &quot;Now on the labour market I 
      find I do not have any skills. I can only become a truck loader.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than 30 years, unemployment in China has been 
      regarded as an evil which labour planners have tried to avoid at all 
      costs,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The planners were once quite complacent about the 
      solution--the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot;. They were confident that a 
      policy of &quot;low salaries and broad employment&quot; would end 
      unemployment in China forever.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the &quot; iron rice bowl &quot; system was a 
      dead-end. Reluctantly,the planners.looked for another way.And even though 
      it would cause pain and difficulties,they recommended<br>
      a system that would permit laying off incompetent staff. That, they felt, 
      would increase efficiency and give ailing enterprises a new lease on life.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For workers affected, lay-off is a bitter pill which 
      some simply cannot swallow.<br>
      For more than 30 years, Chinese people have felt totally secure in their 
      jobs. Now they are facing the possibility of losing their jobs, and many 
      have reacted with panic and horror.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fu Gangzhan, director of the Economic Development 
      Research Institute of the East China University of Chemistry, has studied 
      China's labour problems for many years.<br>
      Two summers ago Fu and his colleagues conducted a survey of several 
      thousand workers and entrepreneurs in Shanghai. Their purpose was to 
      unveil the reality of unemployment in China.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the same period, economics professor Tao Zhaipu 
      of the Zhongshan University in Guangzhou was also studying the employment 
      actualities in China.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came to the same conclusion almost at the same 
      time: unemployment exists and has always existed in China. They found that 
      there was a core of unemployed numbering<br>
      between 15 million to 25 million people in the country. This range is 
      almost the same as the entire populations of Australia and Canada.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ulike unemployment in developed countries, unemployment 
      in China is generally hidden from view.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The State spends 50 to 60 billion yuan ( $16.5 to $ 
      18.9 billion ) each year in the form of salaries, bonuses and other 
      benefits supporting &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; workers who never actually 
      earn a penny for their employers. This expenditure accounts<br>
      for about 50 per cent of the profits handed over to the State by all the 
      enterprises in the country.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Breaking the &quot;Iron Rice Bowl&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his effort to repair the damage of 30 lost 
      years,Deng Xiaoping is abolishing what is called the &quot;iron rice 
      bowl&quot; or &quot;big-pot system&quot;, which guaranteed that workers 
      and peasants shared equal rewards regardless of their contribution. In its 
      place, he has introduced &quot;production responsibility&quot;, which 
      links remuneration to individual effort.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dramatic impact of these reforms is most evident in 
      rural China, home to more than 80 percent of the country's 1.1 billion 
      people. A visit to a township outside Wuxi tells the story. The commune 
      there, like most throughout China, has been dismantled. Instead of being 
      assigned to jobs by a team leader and drawing equal shares from a common 
      revenue pool as in the gast, the peasants contract to work a piece of land 
      and to deLiver a quota of products to the state at a fixed price.<br>
      What they produce above the quota they may keep for their own consumption 
      or sel.l in a free market. They also are encouraged to caltivate bigger 
      private plots and to engage in what are known as &quot;sideline 
      activities&quot; to augment their incomes. The result is that the average 
      household income has increased from about $ 225 a year to $ 350--$400. The 
      most enterprising can earn many times that sum.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauded in the Chinese press as a model for all to 
      follow is the chicken farmer who went into the egg business and amassed a 
      fortune sufficient to enable her to buy China's first privately owned car, 
      as well as two trucks for her enterprise.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere the evidence of rising affluence - in 
      Chinese terms-- is visible. In one town I visited, where hardly a new 
      house had been built for 30 years, nearly 90 percent of the families have 
      now moved into new accommodations. Most homes have radio-cassette players, 
      and a majority have television sets acquired in the past year or so. Less 
      than five years ago, such luxuries were unavailable.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Nanjing, once the capital of the kouomintang 
      government, a visitor sees another.aspect of the personal incentive 
      system. Business booms in a free market of hundreds of .individually 
      operated stalls lining several narrow streets. On sale are vegetables, 
      fruits, chickens and live fish and eels. Buyers are many. Peasant 
      merchants charge what the market will bear and keep what money they get.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are Communist leaders worried that all of this will 
      lead to the emergence<br>
      of a new class of rich peasants'? They insist they are not. &quot;Some 
      peasants prosper early, others will prosper later,&quot; says one 
      official. I7eng puts it as a trickle-down theory: &quot;Make some people 
      rich first s0 as to lead all people to wealth.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. How It Feels to Be Out of Job<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xu Peihua, 26, was fired from her job at the Shanghai 
      No 5 Silk Knitting Factory in january 1987 after she became ill.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The community committce where Xu lived was supposed to 
      compensate her for 70 per cent of her medical expenses for one year after 
      she left the factory. But after a year, her illness got worse.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Shanghai hospital refused Co take her in unless she 
      paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan. After much negotiation with the hospital, 
      she was taken in, after paying 5,000 yuan deposit.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her problems were not over. Her unemployment insurance 
      expired and so she no longer received her 40-yuan monthly pension.She had 
      nowhere to go to get compensation for her hospital fees. Xu needed money 
      urgently, but no institutions would help.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xu's former employer, the Shanghai No 5 Silk Knitting 
      Factory, said that their responsibility for her ended once she was fired. 
      So they refused to give a penny.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shanghai Labour Service Company, which has an 
      unemployment pension fund of 20 million yuan at its disposal, could not 
      help with the medical bills because Xu was no longer eligible for a 
      pension.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither could she receive assistance from the Shanghai 
      Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs. Their welfare coverage extends to 
      divorced people, single seniors, homeless youngsters, relatives of martyrs 
      and soldiers in service, and disabled people. Xu did not fall into any of 
      these categories, so she did not qualify.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not all jobless people share Xu's fate. A window 
      may shut, but a door may open. A number of unemployed people have made a 
      successful transition from &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; to working on their 
      own or for private business.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li Chunying of t.he Shenyang Steel Pipes Factory was 
      one of the few university graduates who lost her job. She had only worked 
      there a year after she had graduated.<br>
      Before the reality of unemployment happened to her, she had only heard 
      ahout such situations in countries like the United States or Japan where 
      some university graduates, even a few with master's or doctor's degrees, 
      could not find a job. ln China, university graduates were highly sought by 
      enterprises.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For four months, Li rode around Shenyang on her bike 
      job-hunting. She wrote three examinations given by potential etnployers 
      and at last got a jub at a research institute that urgently needed 
      translators. It was a job she had long wanted and now was very happy to 
      get.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Li's case shows, losing a job doesn't necessarily 
      mean bad luck. It may even bring a better, more satisfying job.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Job Changing Becomes a Fashion<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It used to be quite an embarrassing thing in China for 
      a person to be dismissed by his or her employer. But things are different 
      now.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take Beijing as an example. Many people now seek the 
      opportunity to be sacked.<br>
      Last year, some 14, 000 people succeeded in leaving their work places by 
      resigning or having their employers dismiss them. Many of them were the 
      backbone of their enterprises, including skilled workers and college 
      graduates just assigned to their work places.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enterprise leaders hold that many things account for 
      the changing of jobs. Some people are not content with the situation in 
      their work units; some are attracted by the higher income of self-employed 
      workers and those who work for foreign interest- involved businesses.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman used to work for a commerce college as a 
      teacher in Beijing, but she found it more interesting to work for a 
      corporation as an office worker.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said: &quot;Satisfaction in my career is what I 
      want.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all of those who left their work units find new 
      jobs instantly. They become frequent visitors to the labour market in the 
      capital. Some are lucky and are well received, but some are not, 
      especially those who do not have special professional skills.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="It"> It</a> is not unusual for some people to 
      try to return to their original work units because they fail to find 
      suitable new jobs.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some who quit enjoy a new success in their career. A 
      street pedlar said, &quot;I just regret I left the factory too 
      late...&quot; The pedlar wore a suit of Western-style clothes and 
      apparently is well-off now.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But another pedlar said that they earn money only 
      through hardship. &quot;We suffer coldness in winter and heat in summer, 
      spending all day in open air.&quot; And he told a reporter that a pedlar 
      who worked near him had returned to his original work unit because he 
      found it too hard to be a self-employed worker.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frequent change of jobs among employees represents 
      a challenge to the years-old job allocation system in China, revealing the 
      fact that people have begun to pay attention to their personal values and 
      have a sense of competition. The flow of personnel in the form of quitting 
      old jobs to find new ones cannot be stopped by mere administrative means. 
      Such a flow is inevitable in the development of a commodity economy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem can only be solved by further reform.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. A Traveling Man's Labour of Love<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese 
      calender, Wang Haihe, 22, is considered by some people as having some of 
      the characteristics of monkeys, such as being lively, nimble and good at 
      climbing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang himself doesn't deny this, since he really can't 
      stand a tranquil and unchanging life. He has been busy moving about since 
      his childhood.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, only a few years later, he has parlayed his energy 
      and interests into a thriving travel business.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As early as when he was in primary school, he and his 
      family spent most of their holidays travelling to nearby mountain areas or 
      to scenic spots in Jiangxian County, Shanxi Province.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Travelling has sometimes meant risk to me, and 
      several times I was on the verge of death when I climbed onto overhanging 
      cliffs,&quot; said Wang. &quot;But this never stops me; in fact, it 
      excites me.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time when Wang graduated from high school, he 
      had set foot on such famous mountains around the country as Taishan in 
      Shandong Province, Huashan in Shaanxi, Hengshan in Hebei and Songshan in 
      Henan. Of all the places he has been, he likes Mt. Huashan best. It is 
      considered one of the most precipitous and dramatic mountains in the 
      country.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was there nine times,&quot; he said. &quot;Each 
      time I reached the summit, I shouted with excitement.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But things went contrary to Wang's interests. He got a 
      job in the local Finance Bureau and worked as a clerk after he graduated 
      from high school.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;From some people's point of view it is a good 
      job, since it is easy, comfortable and safe, but for me it is 
      intolerable,&quot; said Wang.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few months, Wang quit his job, giving up 
      the&quot;iron rice bowl&quot; of security, and on October 1 last year he 
      opened a privatelyowned travel service, the first one in the province. It 
      aims at arousing people' s interest in travel and helps them arrange 
      tours, lodging, transportation, photo-taking, entrance tickets and so on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From information he had collected from newspapers and 
      magazines, he learned that about 100, 000 people in the country every year 
      come to visit the Guandi Temple, the most convenient scenic spot from 
      Jiangxian County.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But very few people from the county came to the 
      place, not because they had been there, but because most people ltere had 
      no idea about travelling,&quot; said Wang. &quot;Most of the youngsters 
      here would think it is a waste of money to travel and thcy spend most of 
      their money on food and clothes.&quot;?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang put advertisements along streets to draw the 
      iuterest of young pcuple.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;From the time I was very young, I dreamed of 
      touring the country's beautiful rivers and mountains,&quot; he said. 
      &quot;When I am out in nature, I always feel relaxed and become 
      open-minded. Now that I have benefited a lot from travelling, I want more 
      people to sha re my feeling, and do my best to help them and make their 
      travel easier and more interesting.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being in business only a week, Wang organized his 
      first group of youths --17 of tbem.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The trip is exciting and really economical, ?said 
      one of the youngsters in the group. &quot;We traveled to Mt. Huashan and 
      Xi'an in Shaanxi Province for three days, an.d each of us only spent 65 
      yuan altogether.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With good knowledge about the legends and historical 
      information about various sites, and having rich experience in arranging 
      trips, Wang soon won the trust of the local people. To his great 
      satisfaction, more and more people in the county have begun to show an 
      interest in travelling, and Wang's travel service has become very popular 
      among young people there.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am very happy with my work now. To me, the 
      'iron rice bowl' is actually an iron lock. I would rather live according 
      to my own de.ires and reaiize my full potential,&quot; he said.<br>
