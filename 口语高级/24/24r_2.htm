<P ALIGN=center><B>2. For Fashion-mad Youth Money Is No Object</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Young women in Beijing are showing a new look in fashions this year. They are wearing elegant long trouser-like skirts and loose <T TYPE=HOT>pantalets</T> with a connected top, both made of colourful <T TYPE=HOT>satin</T>, silk and <T TYPE=HOT>polyester</T>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As a popular saying among young people in the capital nowadays goes ¡ª "Fashion for women and labels for men."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Fashion had been long neglected in Beijing. During the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976), the city was filled with people clad in blue, grey, black and green. Army uniforms were the norm. Green caps, suits and coats were <T TYPE=HOT>in vogue</T>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But no longer. The drab look is no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wherever there are shops, there are some that sell the latest fashions in garments and shoes. Street pedlars and private clothing store owners have been trying to collect new designs from all over the country and to put them on display in the markets as soon as possible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Prominent Beijing garment companies such as Blue Sky, Leimeng and Zaocun have been replaced in popularity by Smart Garments Ltd, Wacoal Co. Ltd. and De-Carty, all of which are joint ventures. Although their clothes are much more expensive than those in ordinary shops, they are selling very well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In the bustling night market of Xidan, one of the busiest shopping centres in Beijing, a young woman was heard commenting on a dress marked at 319 <I>yuan.</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "It would cost three months of my salary, but it's really beautiful," she said. "It's very difficult for people like me who are living on fixed salaries to find something satisfactory. What we like is extremely expensive, and what we can afford we dislike."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A young woman shop assistant said she was attracted to a beautiful skirt one day, but gave up buying it because one of her colleagues had one just like it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I want to be different," she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Nike, Adidas and other world-famous sportswear and shoes have become fashionable among young men who are eager to be with the incrowd. A pair of shoes can set them back 160 <I>yuan,</I> more than a month's salary.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Young people nowadays spend money like they had a hole in their pocket," said an elderly shop assistant. "They buy whatever they like regardless of the price."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I'm not against dressing well, but you have to survive."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     On the fourth floor of the Wangfujing Department Store, a young man chose a 398-yuan dress for his girlfriend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Since I run a <T TYPE=HOT>beauty salon</T>, I have no problem affording a coat like this," the man said casually. "Nowadays people like to start new things to distinguish themselves," a sociologist commented. "It is a psychological breakthrough. People try to preserve their own value and their personality."<BR>
