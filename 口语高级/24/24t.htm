&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When 43-year-old Wang Longzhu stepped out of a beauty parlour in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province in East China, she felt all the people around were staring at her with admiration.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She said, "Years ago, it would be unusual for a middle-aged woman like me to make up because Chinese women who have married and raised children usually do not care much about their appearance."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "When I came home and looked in the mirror, I found myself younger and I felt relaxed and confident," she added.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Wang, an official of a pharmaceutical factory in Nanjing, believes a good appearance may leave people with a better impression in social contacts.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She goes to the Nanjing Dongfang beauty parlour centre to have face massotherapy once a week.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Founded three months ago, the centre has helped more than 100 middle-aged and older people to improve their appearance.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Zhang Yahui, director of the centre, said, "Everyone gets old.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But we can keep our youthful appearance longer through daily care."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Middle-aged and older people in China are now breaking with the conventional idea and paying more attention to keeping fit and caring about their appearance.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> According to a shop assistant of the Taiping Department Store, who looks after a counter selling clothes specially for middle-aged and older people,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> more and more of her senior customers like to buy fashionable and bright-coloured clothes.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The dark and grey uniforms which used to be popular among old people are now unsellable.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He Minsheng, director of a city committee looking after affairs concerning the aged, said that when people are getting old, they often begin to feel useless and lose interest in life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The purpose of the committee is to help them overcome these troubles.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He said the city has set up more than 400 recreational and sports organizations to promote various activities for older people.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Early in the morning, old people can be found performing disco, qigong (a system of deep breathing exercises) and other exercises in gardens and parks.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> However, not all middle-aged and older people in China openly express their views about their wish to remain in good physical condition.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A reporter from a local weekly aimed at senior citizens complained that about 1000 people signed for a recent health-care exercise training course, but few of them are willing to be interviewed.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The reporter said, "Maybe these people are still afraid of being laughed at."</T>
