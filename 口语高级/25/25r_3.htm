<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Some Ads May Be Too Good to Be True</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Advertisements for vocational training courses are seen all over China nowadays. But not all of them are reliable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A spare-time training school affiliated with the Tiexi District library in Shenyang offered a hairdressing course nine times from October 1987 to April 1988, attracting a total of 1,628 students. The eighth term was attended by 348 students. But afterwards, 100 of them sued the school, charging that they had been cheated with false advertising.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The ad had stated that two well-known hairdressers from Hong Kong, one of them a woman, would teach the class and that a third from Shenzhen and a fourth from Guangzhou would also teach. But as turned out, one of the "Hong Kong hairdressers" was a man from Henan Province who had been living in Shenyang since his marriage, and the woman hairdresser was from Guangzhou. The one from Shenzhen never materialized.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The ad also stated that a Hong Kong beauty salon would provide textbooks for the students. But the texts turned out to be only pamphlets printed by a jobless young man. The ad promised to provide an official certificate from the city's education bureau at the end of the course, but the seal on the certificate was that of the school.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The ad said that a spacious and well-furnished classroom would be provided, but a small and <T TYPE=HOT>dilapidated</T> room which could hold no more than 100 people was used instead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A conference room was added, but half of the students still had to stand during the lectures.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The school took a group photo of all 348 students on the first day of the course and started to hand out certificates the following day. A total of 160 certificates were sent out in 20 days, long before the students completed the course.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As a result of the suit, the library was fined 15,000 <I>yuan</I> and the jobless young man had to pay 2,000 <I>yuan.</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The <T TYPE=HOT>proliferation</T> of vocational training courses in China has given rise to a proliferation of related advertisements - in newspapers and on radio and television. A study of a local newspaper by Shenyang's Industrial and Commercial Bureau found that from January to March 1988 the paper ran 220 advertisements and that 99 of them, or 45 per cent, were for vocational training courses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     With flowery phrases and possibly empty promises, these advertisements are often tempting to those who want to get rich quick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In most cases, the shorter the vocational training courses, the easier they appear and the sooner the enrollees hope they can start earning money with what they learned in class. So, naturally, the ads for short courses are all the more tempting.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Who could resist an ad like this:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Want to learn the most updated technique of making <T TYPE=HOT>detergent</T>? You need no equipment except four tubs. Attend our course, and within a week you will learn how to produce 150 kilograms and earn more than 150 <I>yuan</I> a day."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The eagerness with which many people rush to attend vocational training courses in the belief an easier life awaits them afterwards leaves them vulnerable to cheating.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In 1987, a man from a rural area in Shenyang who was anxious to make money met the manager of a soap factory. By various <T TYPE=HOT>illicit</T> means, he got hold of the business license and the seal of the factory. He decided to open a training course on soap and detergent production under the factory's name and to charge a tuition fee of 200 <I>yuan</I> from each applicant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     He advertised in newspapers read by farmers in Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. He immediately received applications from 100 people from 60 counties. The man pocketed 20,000 <I>yuan</I> in tuition fees, but never gave the course. He ended up in jail for fraud, and the factory's business license was revoked.<BR>
