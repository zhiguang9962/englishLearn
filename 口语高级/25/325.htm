      People Change Their Attitudes towards Ads<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, when television began broadcasting a boring 
      TV show, I said to my wife, &quot;The programme is even less interesting 
      than the advertisements, or commercials. Let us have a change.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife, who happened to have a remote control in her 
      hand, consented immediately, switched to another channel and enjoyed an 
      advertisement of riee flour with me. Just at the moment, I found that we 
      were no longer as disgusted with the commercials as we had been before.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day when I told my experience to my 
      colleagues, they, to my surprise, all had the same feeling. A few even 
      sang several of the commercials songs.<br>
      A few years ago, when advertisements began to appear in the Chinese media, 
      most people, including myself, were against the practice. Some sighed: 
      &quot;The socialist TV, newspapers have started imitating the Western 
      bourgeois media too!&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has changed the audience's mentality in only 
      several years' time?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Chinese advertisements have improved their 
      advertising techniques. At the beginning, the language of advertisements 
      was simple, the music insipid and the images coarse and crude. Later, some 
      better foreign advertisements came to Chinese TV and newspapers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where there is a mountain, there is a road; where 
      there is a road, there is a Toyota.&quot; The words of the Japanese 
      advertisement publicizing the Toyota car are very absurd but impressive 
      and easy to memorize. &quot; Nestle coffee is tasty indeed.&quot; The 
      American advertisement promoting the sale of the Nestle brand coffee has 
      become a new household phrase in China.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Chinese advertisements also have learned how 
      to dress themselves up. They have strange and humorous associations, 
      charming, deep male voices, colourful images and songs that are pleasing 
      to the ear and easy to learn.s For these reasons, the commercials for 
      Santana cars, Fud colour film and Orient beverages have successfully 
      attracted a TV audience.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, life needs advertisements. Everything in modern 
      society is linked to information, while the main function of 
      advertisements is to disseminate information on commodities, service, 
      culture, employment, student enrollment and even marriage.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, one can obtain such information by listening 
      to hearsay and making on- the-spot investigation, but the information 
      provided by advertisements in doubtless the most direct, comprehensive and 
      detailed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As society advances, people's demands have become more 
      and mone diversified, and the commodities and service provided by society 
      have also become more and more diversified.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, as living tempo quickens, people 
      have less leisure time. If they want to spend time finding suitable 
      commodities, service and employment opportunities, they have to rely on 
      advertisements. So, unconsciously, people<br>
      have changed their hatred for advertisements to an acceptance and 
      utilization of them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, due to certain conditions in China, the Chinese do 
      not have a great need for advertisements for the time being. That is 
      because Chinese economy is not highly developed,and the supply of many 
      commodities falls short of consumers' demands. So the more consumers see 
      the advertisements, the angrier they become.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, people's living pace has not quickened to the 
      extent that they have no time to go shopping leisurely. Many can even find 
      time to walk the streets during their work hours. There is no need for 
      them to read &quot;the shopping directory&quot;.<br>
      There are even fewer people depending on advertisements to seek 
      employment, for there is not much flow of the labour force.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier this year, I discovered that the annual 
      business volume of a US advertising corporation was as high as $ 6 
      billion, more than 12 per cent of that of China's exports last year. I was 
      really taken aback to find that an advertisement corporation-had developed 
      to such an extent.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that advertising is indispensable to the 
      lives of people in developed countries. Without exception, people read 
      advertisements before going shopping or looking for jobs. It is against 
      this social background that advertising has developed<br>
      so much in these countries.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An idea comes to me: As the economy develops, 
      advertisements may finally penetrate every corner of our life. The day 
      will come when all Chinese will realize that advertising is essential to 
      all of us.<br>

      2. Advertisers Perform a Useful<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Service to the Community<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why 
      they' re always coming in for criticism. Their critics seem to resent them 
      because they have a flair for self-promotion and because they have so much 
      money to throw around. &quot;It's iniquitous,&quot; they say, &quot;that 
      this entirely unproductive industry ( if we can call it that ) should 
      absorb millions of pounds each year. It only goes to show how much profit 
      the big companies are making. Why don't they stop advertising and reduce 
      the price of their goods? After all, it's the consumer who pays...</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor old consumerl He'd have to pay a great deal 
      more if advertising didn't create mass markets for products. It is 
      precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so 
      cheap. But we get the wrong idea if.we think the only purpose of 
      advertising is to sell goods. Another equally important function is to 
      inform . A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods 
      derives largely from the advertisements we read. Advertisements introduce 
      us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know 
      about. Supposing you wanted to buy a washing-machine, it is more than 
      likely you would obtain details regarding performance, price, etc. from an 
      advertisement.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of people pretend that they never read 
      advertisements, but this claim may be seriously doubted. It is hardly 
      possible not to read advertisements these days. And what fun they often 
      are, too! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like 
      without advertisements. Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading 
      railway bye-laws while waiting for a train? Would you like to read only 
      closely- printed columns of news in your daily paper? A cheerful, witty 
      advertisement makes such a difference to a drab wall or a newspaper full 
      of the daily ration of calamities.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must not forget, either, that advertising makes a 
      positive contribution<br>
      to our pockets. Newspapers, commercial radio and television companies 
      could not subsist without this source of revenue. The fact that we pay so 
      little for our daily paper, or can enjoy so many broadcast programmes is 
      due entirely to the money spent by advertisers. Just think what a 
      newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full pricel</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Another thing we mustn,t forget is the &quot;small ads&quot; which are in 
      virtually<br>
      every newspaper and magazine. What a tremendously useful service hey 
      perform for the communityl Just about anything can be accomplished hrough 
      these columns. For instance, you can find a job, or sell a house, announce 
      a birth, marriage or death in what used to be called the &quot;hatch, 
      match and dispatch&quot; columns; but by far the most fascinating section 
      is the personal or &quot;agony&quot; column. No other item in a newspaper 
      provides such entertaining reading or offers such a deep insight into 
      human ature. It,s the best advertisement for advertising there is!</font></p>

      3. Some Ads May Be Too Good to Be True<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertisements for vocational training courses are seen 
      all over China owadays. But not all of them are reliable.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A spare-time training school affiliated with the Tiexi 
      District library in Shenyang offered a hairdressing course nine times from 
      October 1987 to April 1988, attracting a total of 1,628 students. The 
      eighth term was attended by 348 students. But afterwards, 100 of them sued 
      the school, charging that they had been cheated with false advertising.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ad had stated that two well-known hairdressers from 
      Hong Kong, one of them a woman, would teach the class and that a third 
      from Shenzhen and a fourth from Guangzhou would also teach. But as turned 
      out, one of the &quot;Hong Kong hairdressers&quot; was a man from Henan 
      Province who had been living in Shenyang since his marriage, and the woman 
      hairdresser was from Guangzhou. The one from Shenzhen never materialized.<br>
      The ad also stated that a Hong Kong beauty salon would provide textbooks 
      for the students. But the texts turned out to be only pamphlets rinted by 
      a jobless young man.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ad promised to provide an official ertificate from 
      the city' s education bureau at the end of the course, but the seal on the 
      certificate was that of the school.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ad said that a spacious and well-furnished 
      classroom would be provided, but a small and dilapidated room which could 
      hold no more than 100 people was used instead.<br>
      A conference room was added, but half of the students still had to stand 
      during the lectures.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school took a group photo of all 348 students on 
      the first day of the course and started to hand out certificates the 
      following day. A total of 160 certificates were sent out in 20 days, loag 
      before the students completed the course.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the suit, the library was fined 15, 000 
      yuan and the jobless young man had to pay 2,000 yuan.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proliferation of vocational training courses in 
      China has given rise to a proliferation of related advertisements - in 
      newspapers and on radio and television. A study of a locai newspaper by 
      Shenyang's Industrial nd Commercial Bureau found that from January to 
      March 1988 the paper ran 220 advertisements and that 99 of them, or 45 per 
      cent, were for vocatoinal training courses.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With flowery phrases and possibly empty promises, these 
      advertisements re often tempting to those who want to get rich quick.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, the shorter the vocational training 
      courses, the easier they appear and the sooner the enrollees hope they can 
      start earning money with what- they learned in class. So, naturally, the 
      ads for short courses are all the more tempting.<br>
      Who could resist an ad like this:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Want to learn the most updated technique of 
      making detergent? You need no equipment except four tubs. Attend our 
      course, and within a week you will learn how to produce 150 kilograms and 
      earn more than 150 yuan a day.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eagerness with which many people rush to attend 
      vocational training courses in the belief an easier life awaits them 
      afterwards leaves them vulnerabIe to cheating.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1987, a man from a rural area in Shenyang who was 
      anxious to make money met the manager of a soap factory. By various 
      illicit means, he got hold of the business license and the seal of the 
      factory. He decided to open a training course on soap and detergent 
      production under the factory's name and to charge a tuition fee of 200 
      yuan from each applicant.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He advertised in newspapers read by farmers in Liaoning, 
      lilin and Heilongjiang provinces. He immediately received applications 
      from 100 people from 60 counties. The man pocketed 20,000 yuan in tuition 
      fees, but never gave the course. He endcd up in jail for fraud, and the 
      factory's business license was revoked.</font></p>

      4. Fake Advertising Seeks the Gullible<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to make gasoline and diesel fuel in your own home?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to have the capacity to drink a thousand shots of 
      booze without being tipsy?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to add three centimetres a month to your height?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds ridiculous? These impossible dreams have been 
      offered to people in this country. And they are just a few examples of the 
      false advertising that has become one of the major problems hounding a 
      modernizing Chinese society.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the Chinese Consumers ' Association alone 
      received 55,871 complaints about the deceptive advertising, more than 
      doubling the figure for 1987.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of repeated crackdowns their numbers are still 
      increasing each year, according to officials with the State, 
      Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fake advertising, which appears mostly in print media, 
      cheats consumers, and in some serious cases, threatens gullible people's 
      lives.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the latest campaign against phoney hucksters 
      this year,the Beijing Administration of Industry and Commerce has just 
      forbidden all publications to carry the column called &quot;Tips on how to 
      get rich. &quot; Though many people have learned about a product or a 
      technology through the column, much of the information in the column is 
      provided by swindlers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, after a private school advertised that it 
      was offering a course on how to make fluorescent lamp tubes at home, a 
      farmer from Jilin Province came to Beijing to learn the skills.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after spending 30, 000 yuan of family savings, 
      the farmer didn't produce a single tube. Realizing the whole tbing was a 
      hoax, the bankrupt farmer repeatedly attempted suicide.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="A">A</a>ccording to SAIC officials, there are 
      several reasons for the rampant<br>
      fake advertising.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, some enterprises, especially township and 
      private ones, use fake advertising to push sales of their substandard or 
      fake products.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheng Xincheng, a private businessman in Xinjiang, 
      advertised for his &quot;fine cow-hide shoes.&quot; Customers outside 
      Xinjiang sent him 180,000 yuan( $48,000) only to get back inferior plastic 
      shoes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, many newspapers, magazines and other media take 
      the advertising because</font> <font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">they 
      need the money and don't care about the ethics of the ad's contents.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, China does not have effective laws and 
      regulations to prevent such advertising.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. The Language of Advertising<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some products are advertised as having a remarkable and 
      immediate<br>
      effect. We are shown the situation before using the product and this is 
      contrasted with the situation that follows its use. Taking a tablet for a 
      headache in such advertisements can have truly remarkable results. For not 
      only has the headache gone, but the person concerned has often had a new 
      hair-do, acquired a new set of clothes and sometimes even moved into a 
      more modern, betterfurnished house.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing reminds us of another - especially if we 
      often see them together. These reminders are sometimes more imaginary than 
      real: for some people snow may suggest Christmas, for others silver 
      candlesticks may suggest wealth. Theadvertiserencourages us to associate 
      his productwith those things he thinks we really want -- a good job, nice 
      clothes, a sports car, a beautiful girlfriend -- and, perhaps most of all, 
      a feeling of importance. The &quot;image&quot; of a product is based on 
      these associations and the advertiser often creates a &quot;good 
      image&quot; by showing us someone who uses his product and who leads the 
      kind of life we should like to lead.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Advertisements often encourage us to believe that because someone 
      has been successful in one field, he should be regarded as an authority in 
      other fields.<br>
      The advertiser knows that there are certain people we admire because they 
      are famous sportsmen, actors or singers, and he believes that if we 
      discover that a certain well-known personality uses his product, we will 
      want to use it too. This is why so many advertisements feature famous 
      people.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe we can' t always 6elieve what we' re told , but 
      surely we must accept what we're actually shown The trouble is that when 
      we look at the photograph we don't know how the photoraph was taken, or 
      even what was actually photographed. Is that delicious-looking whipped 
      cream really cream, or plastic froth? Are the colours in fact so glowing 
      or has a special filter been used?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often difficult to tell, but you can sometimes 
      spot the photographic<br>
      tricks if you look carefully enough.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you keep talking about something for long enough, 
      eventually people will pay attention to you. Many advertisements are based 
      on this principle.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we hear the name of a product many times a day, we 
      are much more likely to find that. this is the name that comes into our 
      head when the shopkeeper asks &quot;What brand?&quot; We usually like to 
      choose things for ourselves, but if the,advertiser plants a name in our 
      heads in this way he has helped to make the choice for us.6 In this age of 
      moon flights, heart transplants and wonder drugs, we are all impressed by 
      science. If an advertiser links his claim with a scientific fact, there's 
      even a chance we can be blinded by science. The question is simply whether 
      the impressive air of the new discovery or the &quot;man-made 
      miracle&quot; is being used io help or just to hoodwink us.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      7<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertisers may try to make us want a product by 
      suggesting that most people, or the &quot;best&quot;people, already use it 
      and that we will no doubt want to follow them. No one Iikes to be inferior 
      to others and these advertisements suggest that you will be unless you buy 
      the product.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      8<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manufacturer needs a name for his product, and of 
      course helooks for a name that will do more than just identify or label: 
      he wants a name that brings suitable associations as well -- the ideas 
      that the word brings to mind will help sell the product.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      9<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most advertisements contain certain words ( sometimes, 
      but not always, in bold or large letters, or beginning with a capital 
      letter) that are intended to be persuasive, while at the same time 
      appearing to be informative. In describing a product, copy-writers insert 
      words that will conjure up certain feelings,associations and attitudes. 
      Some words--&quot;golden&quot;, for example - seem to have been so 
      successful in selling that advertisers use them almost as if they were 
      magic keys to increase sales.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      10<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertisers may invoke feelings that imply you are not 
      doing the best for those you love most. For example, an advertisement may 
      suggest that any mother who really loves her children uses a certain 
      product. If she does not, she might start to think of herself as a bad 
      mother who does not love her family. So she might go and buy that 
      particular product, rather than go on feeling bad about it.<br>
