      Does Divorce Represent Social Progress?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Divorces-a New Social Phenomenon in China<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divorce used to be very rare in our country. In old 
      times it was not necessary for a man to divorce his wife as he could 
      easily marry another or many others. But women were expected to suffer in 
      silence, and for those who could not, suicide<br>
      was the only way out. Despite the new marriage laws after Liberation, 
      women still found the feudal conventions too strong for them to break away 
      from. The film The Well drove home this point only too well.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's only in the past decade, ever since our opening up 
      to the outside world, that things are really beginning to change. The 
      following story, dramatic as it sounds, is a true and far from unique 
      story of our times.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-year old Xia Yafang used to work in a research 
      institute in Shanghai. Like most young people of her age her ambition was 
      to go abroad and somehow she managed to land herself in Japan. She started 
      to work as a casual labourer in a tourist company in Tokyo. Because of her 
      industry and exceptional ability, and also partly due to chance, she 
      worked herself up to the position of assistant-manager. A brilliant career 
      lay ahead of her and her future looked ever so bright.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all seemed to be plain sailing Xiao Xia suddenly 
      lost her peace of mind when she found the admiring eyes of the manager 
      constantly fixed on her. The message the eyes sent out was too obvious to 
      be mistaken. She read in them admiration, love and desire. She could not 
      remain unmoved, but she was caught in a dilemma. She had a husband at home 
      and also a little son. So when the manager formally proposed to her she 
      naturally told him that the whole thing was impossible as she already had 
      a happy little family. But nothing could put the manager off. So deep was 
      his love for her. He pressed his suit and wanted her to divorce her 
      husband and marry him instead. If she had been a single woman she would 
      have accepted him without any hesitation. Now she did not know what to do.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager gave her a fortnight's leave to go home and 
      talk things over with her husband. If he agreed to let his wife go, the 
      manager would pay him a substantial sum as compensation, and also make 
      arrangement for their son to be brought up and settle in Japan.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she stepped down from her plane at the airport in 
      Shanghai, she immediately spotted her husband with their child in his arm 
      waiting in the crowd. When she saw him pushing his way through the crowd 
      towards her, tears welled up in her eyes and she started to sob 
      uncontrollably.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days that followed, she was overwhelmed by her 
      husband's loving care and tenderness. She just could not bring herself to 
      talk about a divorce. In the end she left Shanghai without mentioning a 
      word about her manager and his offer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that was not the end of the affair. The manager 
      just would not give her up. He decided to come to Shanghai in person and 
      talk to her husband direct. For the first three days he behaved as if 
      there was nothing between him and Xiao Xia. He let the couple take him 
      around in Shanghai, having a nice time like any other tourist. In the 
      process he managed to win the husband's friendship and trust. Then on the 
      third night he invited the husband to his room in his hotel alone. There 
      he put the whole thing to him openly and frankly, disguising nothing. The 
      shock for the husband can well be imagined.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went home to his wife in a dazed state of mind. He 
      didn't mention a word to his wife about his conversation with her manager. 
      There was no need to. She didn't say anything either. She just gave him 
      time to sort things.out for himself.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the initial shock was over, he started to do some 
      clear thinking and cool calculation. His wife no longer loved him, at 
      least not undividedly as before. Even if he should forcibly keep her, the 
      shadow of the manager would always stand between them. She would have a 
      much better future with the manager who could offer her much more than he 
      could ever hope to offer. And their son, too, would have a much better 
      future in that fabulously rich land. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Yes, he must 
      admit it, he was thinking for himself too. The &quot;compensation&quot; 
      the manager offered him was an astronomical figure. With it he could say 
      good-bye to poverty for ever. He could even buy a luxury apartment, a car, 
      and find a beautiful young wife... And so his feeling of loss, his wounded 
      pride gave way to a new found equilibrium.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the necessary procedure of a divorce and her 
      arrangements and application for another marriage, he saw his former wife 
      and her future husband to the airport. What went through his mind as he 
      watched their retreating figures walking<br>
      towards the plane?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiao Xia's story was carried in Shanghaz Legal World. 
      While refraining from moralizing himself, the writer asks the readers to 
      draw their own moral and ethical conclusions. I know many similar cases 
      involving people close to me. In fact I had to act as the legal 
      representative for one. The woman in the office that handled the case told 
      me that such divorce cases ( involving one party that has gone abroad ) 
      are very common. So long as no questions of property or care of children 
      are involved, divorces are granted without any questions asked.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">II . Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. On Splitting<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One affternoon recently, two unrelated friends called 
      to tell me that, well, their marriages hadn't made it. One was leaving his 
      wife for another woman. The other was leaving her husband because &quot; 
      we thought it best.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always after such increasingly common calls, I felt 
      helpless and angry. What had happened to those solemn vows that one of the 
      couples had stammered on a steamy August afternoon three years earlier? 
      And what had happened to the joy my wife and I had sensed when we visited 
      the other couple and their two children last year, the feeling they gave 
      us that here, in this increasingly fractionated world, was a constructive 
      union?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not feel anger at my friends personally: Given 
      the era and their feelings, their decisions probably made sense. What 
      angered me was the loss of years and energy. It was an anger similar to 
      that I feel when I see abandoned faundations of building projects - piled 
      bricks and girders and a gash in the ground left to depress the passerby.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our grandparents married, nobody except scandalous 
      eccentrics<br>
      divorced. &quot;As long as we both shall live?was no joke. Neither was the 
      trepidation brides felt on the eves of their wedding days. After their 
      vows, couples learned to live with each other-- not necessarily because 
      they loved each other, but because they were stuck, and it was better to 
      be stuck comfortably than otherwise.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the external pressures that helped to enforce 
      our grandparents' vows have dissolved. Women can earn money and may enjoy 
      sex, even, bear children, without marrying. As divorce becomes more 
      common, the shame attendant on it dissipates. Some divorcees even argue 
      that divorce is beneficial, educational, that the second' on third or 
      fifth marriage is &quot;the best&quot;. The only reasons left to marry are 
      love, tax advantages, and, for those old-fashioned enough to care abour 
      such things, to silence parental kvetching.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some respects, this freedom can be seen as social 
      progress. Modern couples can flee the corrosive bitterness that made 
      Strindberg's marriages<br>
      night-mares. Dreiser's Clyde Griffiths might have abandbned his Roberta 
      instead of drowning her.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other respects, our rapidly-rising divorce rate and 
      the declining. marriage rate (as more and more couples opt to forgo 
      legalities and simply Iive together) represent a loss. One advantage of 
      spending a lifetime with a person is seeing each other grow and change. 
      For most of us, it is possible to see history in the bathroom mirro--gray 
      Hairs, crow's feet, yes, but not a change of mind or temperament. Yet, 
      living with another person, it is impossible not to notice how patterns 
      and attitudes<br>
      change and not to learn - about yourself and about time --from those 
      perceptions.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the most poignant victim of the twentieth 
      centatry is our sense of continuity. People used to grow up with trees, 
      watch them evolve from saplings to fruit bearers to gnarled' and 
      unproductive grandfathers. Now unless one is a farmer or a forester there 
      is almost no point to planting trees because one is not likely to be there 
      to enjoy their maturity. We change addresses and occupations and hobbies 
      and lifestyles and spouses rapidly and readily, much as we change TV 
      channels.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our grandparents' day one committed oneself to 
      certain skills and disciplines and developed them. Caipenters spent 
      lifetimes learning their craft; critics spent lifetimes learning 
      literature. Today, the question often is not &quot;What do you do?&quot; 
      but &quot;What are you into?&quot; Macrame one week, astrology the next, 
      health food, philosophy, history, jogging, movies, EST - we fly from 
      &quot;commitment&quot; to &quot;commitment&quot; like bees among flowers 
      because it is easier to test something than to master it, easier to buy a 
      new toy than to repair an old one.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel sorry for what my divorced friends have lost. No 
      matter how earnestly the former spouses try to &quot;keep in touch,&quot; 
      no matter how generous the visiting privileges for the parent who does not 
      win custody of the children, the continuity of their lives has been 
      broken. The years they spent together have been cut off from the rest of 
      their lives; they are an isolated memory, no more integral to their past 
      than a snapshot. Intelligent people, they will compare their next 
      marriages -- if they have them - to their first. They may even, despite 
      not having a long shared past, notice growth. What I pray, though, is that 
      they do not delude themselves into believing, like so many Americans 
      today, that happiness is only measurable moment to moment and, in the 
      pursuit of momentary contentment, forsake the perspectives and consolation 
      of history.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is great joy in watching a tree grow.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Kramer vs Kramer<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted Kramer is a rising young executive in an 
      advertising firm. He has just been promoted to a new responsible post and 
      a brilliant career is before him. When he comes home with the happy news, 
      his wife Joanna announces her decision to leave him. At first he doesn't 
      take her seriously, thinking it was just a passing mood. He just can' t 
      imagine why she should want to abandon a comfortable life (he brings in 
      good money) and a happy family (they have a lovely boy). In all fairness 
      he has never ill-treated her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to Joanna her married life has been an utter 
      failure -- meaningless fatal hour, Joanna turns up, not to take Billy 
      away, but to announce her decision to give up her claim to the custody of 
      her son. She has come to realize how much father and son now mean to each 
      other and she has no heart to upset their lives again. In sorrow and in 
      tears all she asks for is a last meeting with her son before she goes out 
      of their lives forever.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Problems Arising from Living Apart<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese household registration system forbids 
      permanent dwelling without legal registration with the local public 
      security units. Yet many people leave their hometowns - bringing with them 
      their residence cards -- to get further education or to join the army, or 
      because they are transferred to jobs in other places.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The separation of married couples thereby occurs, and 
      it has become a growing concern in China for the various problems it 
      causes. Separation can lead to family crisis or divorce. Just as a society 
      as a Whole requires solidity, a family.demands unity and stability. But 
      this is exactly what separated couples lack -- as well as the happiness 
      that comes from living together. As a result, some couples end up 
      permanently separated and divorced, as emotional ties between husband and 
      wife erode.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The damage is not confined to the couples alone. The 
      absence of normal family life can leave the children ill-educated and the 
      aged uncared for, which can contribute to the instability of the whole 
      society.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those living apart (an estimation of 6 million), 
      the government grants one month paid home leave every year to one spouse. 
      This equals more than 10 million lost work days, the equivalent of 300, 
      000 people not working at all each year. In addition to the travel 
      expenses, this costs the government a total of 2.2 billion yuan a year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, these &quot;travellers&quot; add to 
      congestion in the already overloaded public transportation system.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To end the misery of living apart, some couples 
      seek.solutions by &quot;back-door&quot; means, by inviting officials to 
      parties or presenting them with gifts. While some succeed, most couples 
      meet with frustration. Of the ones who succeed, some fail to find new jobs 
      that match their skills and specialties.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unremitting efforts have been made by the government to 
      ease the problems arising from living apart. Yet, they cannot be solved 
      cornpletely.. There are several reasons for this.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One obstacle involves job transfers. Most work units 
      are unwilling to accept administrative personnel, and they do not wish to 
      hand over the valuable mernbers of their staff to other units. In 
      addition, most separated spouses who live in large cities dislike moving 
      to small cities or to the countryside, and southerners do not want to go 
      to the north.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For another thing, some enterprises hxve become highly 
      money oriented, demanding steep compensation for training fees from those 
      who want to quit their jobs. In 1988, 300 to 700 yuan was demanded, but 
      this fee has risen to 1,000 to 7,000 yuan this year. Similarly, the fee 
      for those who apply for a new post grew from between 1,000 and 5,000 yuan 
      last year to between 7,000 and 13,000 yuan early this year, and in some 
      large cities, the fee runs.as high as 40,000 yuan.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Job mobility should be encouraged and special 
      consultations should be held for the purpose of exchanging employees in 
      different parts of the country. Meanwhile, granting job transfers should 
      not be treated as a good profit-making deal, and people who offer or 
      accept bribes should be penalized.<br>
