<P ALIGN=center><B>1. About Old Age</B></P><BR>
Day: Professor McKay, can you tell me what you think your report on old people will achieve?<BR>
Mckay: We hope that it will help to change people's feelings about old age. The problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor, sick, lonely and unhappy. As a result, we tend to find old people, as a group, unattractive. And this is very dangerous for our society.<BR>
Day: But surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick.<BR>
Mckay: No, we can't. But we must also remember that the proportion of such people is no greater among the 60 to 70 age group than among the 50 to 60 age group.<BR>
Day: In other words, there is no more mental illness, for example, among the 60's to 70's than among the 50's to 60's?<BR>
Mckay: Right. And why should there be? Why should we expect people to suddenly change when they reach their 60th or 65th birthday any more than they did when they reached their 21st? Now that the computer age has arrived in industry, the normal age for retirement may be lowered to 60 or even 55. Shall we then say that old age begins at 55?<BR>
Day: But one would expect there to be more physical illness among old people, surely?<BR>
Mckay: Why should one expect this? After all, those people who reach the age of 65 or 70 are the strong among us. The weak die mainly in childhood, then in their 40's and 50's. Furthermore, by the time people reach 60 or 65, they have learnt how to look after themselves: they keep warm, sleep regular hours, and eat sensibly. Of course, some old people do suffer from physical illnesses, but these do not suddenly develop on their 65th birthday. People who are healthy in middle age tend to be healthy in old age, just as one would expect.<BR>
Day: Are people's mental abilities affected by old age? <BR>
Mckay: Certain changes do take place as we grow older, but this happens throughout life. These changes are very gradual, and happen at different times with different people. But, in general, if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems, you will easily recognize him in old age.<BR>
Day: So that someone who enjoys new experiences ¡ª travel, education, and so on ¡ª in his middle years will usually continue to do so into old age?<BR>
Mckay: Exactly. We have carried out some very interesting experiments in which a group of people aged 60 to 70 and a group aged 30 to 40 had to learn the same things. For example, in one experiment they began learning a new language. In another, they learnt how to use three machines in order to make a piece of furniture. The first thing we discovered was that the young group tended to be quicker at learning than the old group. However, although the old group took longer to learn, eventually they performed as well as the young group. And when we tested the two groups several weeks later, there was again no difference between the two groups.<BR>
Day: That's very interesting indeed. What else did your experiments show?<BR>
Mckay: Well, one group of old people agreed to attend evening classes for a year to study English and Mathematics. In fact, most of this group became so interested in their studies that they continued them for another year. Anyway, we discovered that they did best in the English classes, and that most of them steadily improved their ability to communicate in both the written and the spoken language. This didn't really surprise us because other studies have had similar results. And, of course, you can think of a dozen writers who continued working almost to the day they died.<BR>
Day: What about the group who studied Mathematics?<BR>
Mckay: Well, that's a different story. There seems to be no doubt that people find maths more difficult as they grow older. Though why this is so, I cannot say.<BR>
Day: Perhaps cheap pocket computers will solve this problem.<BR>
Mckay: I think you're right. In fact, I'm sure that you are.<BR>
