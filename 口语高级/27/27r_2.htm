<P ALIGN=center><B>2. The Oldest People in the World</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Thousands of people in the world are a hundred years old ¡ª or more. There are about two thousand <T TYPE=HOT>centenarians</T> in Britain alone, and certain parts of the world are famous for the long lives of their inhabitants: Georgia in the Soviet Union, the Vilacamba Valley in Ecuador, and the home of the Hunzas in the Himalayas. But the oldest person in the world is Japanese. In 1983 Mr. Shigechiyo Izumi, aged 118, held first place in <I>The Guinness Book of Records.</I> He was born on June 29th, 1865 and beat the previous record on his 114th birthday. Before Mr. Izumi broke the record, the longest life was that of an American woman, Mrs. Eveline Filkins. She lived for 113 years, 214 days, from 1815 to 1928. During her lifetime she saw the invention of the first camera, the first telephone, the first car, the first aeroplane and the first television. There are official papers to prove the date of birth of Mr. Izumi and Mrs. Filkins, but many other people claim to be as old or older.<BR>
