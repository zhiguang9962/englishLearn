&nbsp; &nbsp;      China has set up 916 colleges for senior citizens, educating about 200,000 people in the past five years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The colleges offer more than 60 courses ranging from calligraphy, painting and gardening to qigong, massage and foreign languages.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The students are mainly retired government functionaries but, according to an official from the Association of Colleges for the Elderly, the colleges are trying to serve senior citizens from the whole of society.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Some institutions are already giving courses in gardening, crop planting and animal husbandry to old people from the countryside.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     According to a poll conducted by the Harbin senior citizens college in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang, of its first 200 graduates, 71 per cent had recovered from chronic diseases since their registration, and 85 per cent were "very confident" that they will live longer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Many of the students are again working for the society instead of being just consumers. During each semester, about 60 per cent of the students of the college serve society while studying.<BR>
