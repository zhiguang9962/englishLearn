<P ALIGN=center><B>6. The Alcohol Limit and the Punishment</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The limit of the amount of alcohol a driver is allowed to have in his blood is 80 milligrams for every 100 millilitres of blood: that is about one and a half litres of beer, or one double whisky.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     If the driver is convicted of "being drunk while in charge of a motor vehicle", the usual sentence is a) a heavy fine. b) disqualification from driving for 12 months.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     If the driver causes an accident, the sentence can be stricter. For example, a drunken driver who killed a pedestrian was sent to prison for 9 months, as well as being fined and losing his licence for a year. (A demonstrator who destroyed a tennis court as a protest was sent to prison for 18 months.)<BR>
