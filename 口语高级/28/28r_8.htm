<P ALIGN=center><B>8. Different Opinions on the Alcohol Limit</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Chief Inspector Kale (Head of Southern Police) would like the alcohol limit lowered and sentences made tougher.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mrs. Nash (a lawyer) is often professionally involved in drinking and driving cases. She thinks judges are too kind, and that sentences should be made tougher.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Dr. Smalby has been asked to explain the effects of alcohol. He says that it slows down reactions, and affects vision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mrs. Houghton, whose six-year-old son, Tommy, was killed by a drunken driver. She thinks the driver should have been sent to prison for life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mr. Lambert knocked down a pedestrian while slightly drunk. He feels very guilty, and is convinced it would not have happened if he had not had a few drinks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mr. Crosby lost his licence six months ago, and, as a result, his job. He feels he was driving quite properly, and that the law was, and is, far too strict.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mrs. Austin lost her licence after having three whiskies. She was driving because her husband was drunk. She thinks she drives perfectly well after three whiskies and that the law is unfair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     James Connery (a famous racing driver) thinks that everybody reacts differently to alcohol. (He would be quite safe after drinking three whiskies.) He thinks the limit should be raised.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Gabrielle Savage (a famous film actress) thinks the law should be abolished because it stops people having a good time.<BR>
