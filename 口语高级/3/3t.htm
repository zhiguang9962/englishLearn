&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It is said that Shanghai's musicians abroad could form a world-class symphony orchestra.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra once failed to find a qualified conductor for a whole year!</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A similar situation exists in science, medicine and sports circles.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Stopping the outflow of talent depends on creating a sound domestic environment rather than simply setting up barriers for those who wish to go abroad.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A handful of people go abroad to seek a comfortable life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But most Chinese intellectuals emigrate because they cannot bring their talent into full play in their motherland.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many conductors trained by the Shanghai Conservatory of Music have gone abroad either because they cannot find jobs in symphony orchestras due to the competition for places,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> or because they cannot develop themselves in orchestras where promotion comes only by way of seniority.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We face a keen shortage of talent, but one batch of gifted people after another have gone abroad.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The situation is grim.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It is impossible to improve the conditions for all intellectuals by a wide margin.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it is possible for governments at all levels to create a better environment for their development.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The outflow of talent is a loss to our nation as well as a pressure forcing us to optimize the environment for the talented.</T>
