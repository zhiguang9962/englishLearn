<P ALIGN=center><B>4. Criticism Is a Kind of Demand on Those Criticized</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As children, many of us got a great deal of criticism and, as a result, learned a variety of patterns for coping with it. Marya had apparently received little criticism, but, knowing that she was not perfect and deserved what other children got, developed her own patterns of self-judgment and <T TYPE=HOT>censure</T>. Being judged, whether we are underestimated or overestimated, usually implies a demand, subtle or direct, that we change. If others do not demand change, we may feel the need to demand it of ourselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Reactions that are relatively free from attempts to change or discredit us, given by someone who cares for us, and with the intention of letting us know what impressions we are making, may be easier to take. If, however, our usual reaction is to defend ourselves, even mild criticism or impressions given gently without demands that we change may play <T TYPE=HOT>havoc</T> with our defensive structure and become difficult to handle.<BR>
