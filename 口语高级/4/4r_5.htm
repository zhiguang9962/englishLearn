&nbsp; &nbsp;     The surgeon reached over and jerked the <T TYPE=HOT>syringe</T> out of the nurse's hand. "Jane, that's the sloppiest injection I've ever seen!" he snapped. Quickly, his fingers found the vein she had been searching for. Cheeks burning, Jane turned away. Ten years later, Jane's voice still trembles when she relates the experience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Some of our male co-workers have it easier. They grew up encouraged to play team sports, and they had to handle a coach's yells when they dropped the ball. Now they can see that a <T TYPE=HOT>goof</T> on the job is like dropping the ball in football; the fumble is embarrassing, but you take it in stride and go on.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But for most women, the path to success was different. As girls, we grew up wanting to be popular; we were praised for what we were, not for what we did. So our reaction to criticism is often, "Someone doesn't like me. I failed to please. I'm a failure."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I get defensive," says Rhonda, a teacher, "When someone criticizes me, suddenly I'm a little girl again, being scolded, and I want to make excuses. I want to explain that it's not my fault - it's someone else's, or I want to hide and cry."<BR>
