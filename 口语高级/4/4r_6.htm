&nbsp; &nbsp;     How about giving criticism? The old "I-want-to-be-liked" <T TYPE=HOT>syndrome</T> can make it as hard to give criticism as to take it. Karen thinks she's found the answer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Two weeks after I was promoted to first-line supervisor," she remembers, "I had to tell a friend that she was in trouble for not turning in her weekly reports on time. My boss suggested that I tell Judy I didn't want to fix the blame - I just wanted to fix the problem. That was wonderful advice. It allowed me to state the problem objectively to Judy and she offered the solution."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Criticism in the workplace, whether you're giving it or getting it, is always more effective when you focus on the task rather than on the person. Fixing the problem, not the blame, means that nobody has to feel <T TYPE=HOT>chewed out</T> or <T TYPE=HOT>chewed up</T>. We can still feel whole and learn something in the process.<BR>
