<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Mercy or Murder?</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     On June 20, 1973, 23 year old Lester M. Zygnamiak walked into his older brother George's hospital room at Jersey Shore Medical Centre in Neptune, New Jersey, and shot his brother dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     George had been paralyzed from the neck down in an automobile accident several days earlier. The doctor had told his family that the 26 year old boy would probably be paralyzed for life and would never walk again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The Zygnamiaks were an extremely close family. Lester idolized his older brother and would have done anything for him, but now he felt torn. After three intensely emotional days, he decided to obey his brother's wishes. When Lester visited his brother's hospital room, he said, "I am here today to end your pain. Is that all right with you?" His brother nodded and said yes. Then a shot rang out. Hospital staff rushed to the room, and Lester was soon hauled off to jail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Lester stood trial for his brother's murder, but was acquitted on November 5,1973, on the grounds of temporary <T TYPE=HOT>insanity</T>. The court had determined that he was no longer insane, and Lester was released.<BR>
