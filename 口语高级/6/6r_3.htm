<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Mrs. Ross Killed Her Daughter Because She Loved Her</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mercy killing, or euthanasia (from the Greek, eu ¡ª meaning good and thanos ¡ª meaning death; thus, "a good death") is against the law. It is considered a criminal offense. Yet individuals brought to trial for actual mercy killings are rarely convicted. Like Lester Zygnamiak, they are usually released. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Such was the case with Anna Marie Ross. At twenty-five Mrs. Ross gave birth to her first child, a baby girl she and her husband named Paula. The Rosses had wanted a child for several years, but during her pregnancy Mrs. Ross had unknowingly taken a damaging drug called Thalidomide, which caused Paula to be born severely disfigured. The infant had no arms or legs and her face was badly deformed. Although Paula was of normal intelligence, she was totally deaf and had very poor vision. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Paula was expected to live a normal life span. But to survive, she would have to undergo numerous operations. It was expected that she would spend much of her life in hospitals. Anna Ross often stated that she firmly believed her child's normal intelligence would only make her more cruelly aware of her fate. She felt certain that Paula's life would be filled with anguish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     So one night she put Paula to bed and gave her a bottle containing a strong sedative. The baby died painlessly during the night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Anna Ross readily admitted to the killing. She said, "I killed little Paula because I loved her. I brought her into the world, and she was unable to end her constant pain and misery. I felt I had to send her to God."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A survey of more than 10,000 people taken by a local newspaper indicated that over 98 percent agreed with Anna Ross's action. When she stood trial, a jury found Mrs. Ross not guilty in under three hours.<BR>
