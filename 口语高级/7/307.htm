      Do Examinations Do More Harm Than Good?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      On Eggs and Exams<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been acting like an egg striking a rock. What is 
      this egg? It's the campaign against the old-fashioned way of teaching 
      Intensive Reading . And what' s the rock?. It' s the old-fashioned way of 
      setting exams. So long as the old type of I.R. examination remains in 
      force, the campaign against the old method of teaching I.R. can't win. 
      It's like an egg striking a rock.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people agree: Yes, this old-fashioned I.R. (OFIR) 
      is certainly intensive; it calls for most intensive work by the students. 
      But it doesn't teach them how to read. The more intensively the students 
      study, the fewer books they read.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And OFIR doesn't teach them language well either. 
      Learning a language means learning to use it. OFIR doesn't do that. It 
      teaches mainly about the language.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if so many teachers and students agree that OFIR 
      doesn't teach people how to read, why aren't they willing to give it up? 
      Because of that rock - the rock of the old examination system. If that 
      rock is not smashed, the egg is smashed. The campaign against OFIR can't 
      be won.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many I. R. exams, until now, have actually includec 
      reading material studied during the term. Does that examim how well the 
      students have learnt to read? No. It examine how well they have learnt by 
      heart the reading texts and the explanations the teacher has given them. A 
      student might ge high marks on such .a test without having learnt to read 
      much better than before she took the course. A true test would consist<br>
      of unseen passages. That would show how well a studew could read and how 
      much she had learnt.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that so important? Yes. A college student should 
      know how to read and should learn to read much and fast. She should, on 
      graduation, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages, dozens and dozens of 
      books. .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How else can our students inherit the knowledge that 
      mankind has gained through the ages? For that is what China must do in 
      order to modernize.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, reading in itself is not enough. We must 
      think - think about what we read and analyze its content, idea: and 
      ap.proach. &quot;Cultivate the habit of analysis.&quot; That is the aim of 
      education. But we must have something solid to analyze. We must have some 
      knowledge of the world, of nature, of society, past and present, Chinese 
      and foreign. So we must read much. Therefore we must learn to read fast.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, we do need to know something about the 
      language. We do need to know some grammar. But grammar is only a means to 
      an end, not an end in itself. For grammar, after all, is theory. And 
      &quot;what is theory for and where does it come from ? It comes from 
      practice and serves practice.&quot; The same applies to grammar. So we 
      need to do some intensive reading for the sake of extensive reading, for 
      the sake of reading whole articles, whole books. A little theory goes a 
      long way. The final test is practice.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True, reading is far from the only source of knowledge. 
      Reading without observing life and taking part in life, without 
      experimenting, will produce bookworms, not modernizers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not show that all kinds of I. R. are 
      absolutely useless and should be scrappeds. Some I . R . should be kept 
      but it should be kept within limit. It should not be &quot;the super-power 
      course&quot;, riding roughshod over the language curriculum<br>
      and taking over most of the timetable. And what I . R . we keep and teach 
      should not be so long and so hard that the teacher is forced to use the 
      duck-stuffing, lecturing method. And it should not just focus on 
      &quot;words, words, words &quot;. It should focus on meaning, on ideas, on 
      understanding, on communication - on forests as well as on<br>
      trees.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as long as students are forced to get good marks in 
      order to get good jobs; and as long as teachers want their students to get 
      good marks so that they themselves can gain fame as good teachers, then 
      everything depends on examinations. It depends on what sort of exams w e 
      teachers set and the educational<br>
      authorities demand. Until we reform our exams we can hardly reform our 
      teaching methods.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's launch a new campaign, to discuss and reform 
      the exam system; and at the same time continue the campaign against OFIR, 
      the super-power. We need to fight on two fronts at once. Otherwise we'll 
      be eggs striking rocks.<br>

      2. The General Certificate of Education at O Level<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people discuss education they insist that 
      preparation for examiriations<br>
      is not the main purpose. They are right in theory, but in practice, we all 
      realize how importarit examinations are. What do you know about the 
      examinations taken at English secondary schools? Here are a few facts 
      about some of them. .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pupils who remain at school until they are sixteen 
      normally take what is called the Geneial Certificate of Education at 
      Ordinary level. The examination is a subject examination. This means you 
      can take a number of subjects. Some pupils take as many as ten. The more 
      subjects the better chance a pupil has of getting a job on leaving school.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Homework Row Led to the Death of a Girl<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nine-year old girl was beaten to death by her mother 
      for failing to finish the day's homework in time.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liu Lin- was a third-year pupil in a primary school in 
      a Tibetan autonomous<br>
      prefecture in Northwest Qinghai Province: She was one of the best students 
      in her school, according to yesterday's Workers' Daily.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on July 10, she did not do her arithmetic homework 
      when Sun Fengxia, her mother, got home from work at 16:00 p.m.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sun severely beat her daughter with a rolling pin, the 
      newspaper said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 19:30 p.m. that evening, she found that her daughter 
      had done only part of the homework, and she became even more angry.<br>
      Sun slapped her daughter in the face and kicked her, according to the 
      paper.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lin became unconscious and later died despite efforts 
      of doctors to save her.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such cases are not rare in China.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December last year in the province, Wu Yuxia beat 
      her nine-year old son Xia Fei to death . She later committed suicide in a 
      prison.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Dalian of Northeast Liaoning Province, Li Liansheng 
      beat his 14- year old son Li Guobin to death in March last year because 
      the boy was playing truant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Nanjing, capital of coastal Jiangsu Province, 
      19-year old Wang Lin killed his parents at home because they forced him to 
      try to get good marks in examinations.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Examinations Are Primitive Methods<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      of Testing Knowledge and Ability<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might marvel at the progress made in every field of 
      study, but the methods of testing a Person's knowledge and ability remain 
      as primitive as they ever were. It really is extraordinary that after all 
      these years, educationists have still failed to devise anything more 
      efficient and reliable than examinations. For all the pious claim that 
      examinations test what you know, it is cotnmon knowledge that they more 
      often do the exact opposite. They may be a good means of testing memory, 
      or the knack of working rapidly under extreme pressure, but they can tell 
      you nothing about a person's true ability and aptitude.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. Examinations Are Anxiety-makers<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As anxiety-makers, examinations are second to none. 
      That is because so much depends on them. They are the mark of success or 
      failure in our society. Your whole future may be decided in one fateful 
      day. It doesn't matter that you weren't feeling very well, or that your 
      mother died. Little things like that don't count: the exam goes on. No one 
      can give of his best when he is in mortal terror,or after a sleepless 
      night, yet this is precisely what the examination system expects him to 
      do. The moment a child begins school, he enters a world of vicious 
      competition where success and failure are clearly defined and measured. 
      Can we wonder at the increasing number of &quot;drop-outs&quot;: young 
      people who are written off as utter failures before they have even 
      embarked on a career? Can we be surprised at the suicide rate among 
      students?</font></p>

      6. The Examination System Never Trains<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      You to Think for Yourself<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good education should, among other things, train you 
      to think for yourself. The examination system does anything but that. What 
      has to be learnt is rigidly laid down by a syllabus, so the student is 
      encouraged to memorise. Examinations do not motivate a student to read 
      widely, but to restrict his reading; they do not enable him to seek more 
      and more knowledge, but induce cramming. They lower the standards of 
      teaching, for they deprive the teacher of all freedom. Teachers themselves 
      are often judged by examination results and instead of teaching their 
      subjects, they are reduced to training their students in exam technipues 
      which they despise. The most successful, candidates are not always the 
      best educated; they are the best trained in the technique of working under 
      duress.</font></p>

      7. Exam Is a Subjective Assessment by Some<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Anonymous Examiner<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results on which so much depends are often nothing 
      more than a subjective assessment by some anonymous examiner. Examiners 
      are only human. They get tired and hungry: they make mistakes. Yet they 
      have to mark stacks of hastily scrawled scripts in a limited amount of 
      time. They work under the same sort of pressure as the candidates. And 
      their word carries weight.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;After a 
      judge,s decision you have the right of appeal, but not after an 
      examiner's. There must surely be many simpler and more effective ways of 
      assessing a person's true abilities. Is it cynical to suggest that 
      examinations are merely a profitable business for the institutions that 
      run them? This is what it boils down to in the last analysis. The best 
      comment on the system is this illiterate message recently scrawled on a 
      wall: &quot;I were a teenage drop-out and now I are a teenage millionaire.
