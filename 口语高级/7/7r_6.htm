<P ALIGN=center><B>6. The Examination System Never Trains You to Think for Yourself</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         A good education should, among other things, train you to think for yourself. The examination system does anything but that. What has to be learnt is rigidly laid down by a <T TYPE=HOT>syllabus</T>, so the student is encouraged to memorise. Examinations do not motivate a student to read widely, but to restrict his reading; they do not enable him to seek more and more knowledge, but induce cramming. They lower the standards of teaching, for they deprive the teacher of all freedom. Teachers themselves are often judged by examination results and instead of teaching their subjects, they are reduced to training their students in exam techniques which they <T TYPE=Hot>despise</T>. The most successful candidates are not always the best educated; they are the best trained in the technique of working <T TYPE=HOT>under duress</T>.<BR>
