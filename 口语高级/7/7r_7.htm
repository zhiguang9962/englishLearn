<P ALIGN=center><B>7. Exam Is a Subjective Assessment by Some Anonymous Examiner</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The results on which so much depends are often nothing more than a subjective assessment by some anonymous examiner. Examiners are only human. They get tired and hungry; they make mistakes. Yet they have to mark stacks of hastily <T TYPE=HOT>scrawled</T> scripts in a limited amount of time. They work under the same sort of pressure as the candidates. And their word carries weight. After a judge's decision you have the right of appeal, but not after an examiner's. There must surely be many simpler and more effective ways of assessing a person's true abilities. Is it <T TYPE=HOT>cynical</T> to suggest that examinations are merely a profitable business for the institutions that run them? This is what it boils down to in the last analysis. The best comment on the system is this illiterate message recently scrawled on a wall: "I were a teenage drop-out and now I am a teenage millionaire."<BR>
