<P align=center><B><T TYPE=SEN>On Eggs and Exams</T></B></P><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I've been acting like an egg striking a rock.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What is this egg?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's the campaign against the old-fashioned way of teaching Intensive Reading.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And what's the rock?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's the old-fashioned way of setting exams.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So long as the old type of I.R. examination remains in force, the campaign against the old method of teaching I.R. can't win.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's like an egg striking a rock.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many people agree: Yes, this old-fashioned I.R. (OFIR) is certainly intensive; it calls for most intensive work by the students.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it doesn't teach them how to read.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The more intensively the students study, the fewer books they read.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And OFIR doesn't teach them language well either.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Learning a language means learning to use it.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> OFIR doesn't do that.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It teaches mainly about the language.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Well, if so many teachers and students agree that OFIR doesn't teach people how to read, why aren't they willing to give it up?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Because of that rock ！ the rock of the old examination system.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If that rock is not smashed, the egg is smashed.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The campaign against OFIR can't be won.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many I.R. exams, until now, have actually included reading material studied during the term.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Does that examine how well the students have learnt to read?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No. It examines how well they have learnt by heart the reading texts and the explanations the teacher has given them.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A student might get high marks on such a test without having learnt to read much better than before she took the course.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A true test would consist of unseen passages.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That would show how well a student could read and how much she had learnt.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Is that so important?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Yes. A college student should know how to read and should learn to read much and fast.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She should, on graduation, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages, dozens and dozens of books.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> How else can our students inherit the knowledge that mankind has gained through the ages?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For that is what China must do in order to modernize.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of course, reading in itself is not enough.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We must think ！ think about what we read and analyze its content, ideas and approach.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Cultivate the habit of analysis."</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That is the aim of education.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But we must have something solid to analyze.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We must have some knowledge of the world, of nature, of society, past and present, Chinese and foreign.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So we must read much.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Therefore we must learn to read fast.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Naturally, we do need to know something about the language.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We do need to know some grammar.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But grammar is only a means to an end, not an end in itself.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For grammar, after all, is theory.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And "what is theory for and where does it come from? It comes from practice and serves practice."</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The same applies to grammar.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So we need to do some intensive reading for the sake of extensive reading, for the sake of reading whole articles, whole books.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A little theory goes a long way.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The final test is practice.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> True, reading is far from the only source of knowledge.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Reading without observing life and taking part in life, without experimenting, will produce bookworms, not modernizers.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This does not show that all kinds of I.R. are absolutely useless and should be scrapped.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some I.R. should be kept ！ but it should be kept within limits.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It should not be "the super-power course", riding roughshod over the language curriculum and taking over most of the timetable.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And what I.R. we keep and teach should not be so long and so hard that the teacher is forced to use the duck-stuffing, lecturing method.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And it should not just focus on "words, words, words".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It should focus on meaning, on ideas, on understanding, on communication ！ on forests as well as on trees.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But as long as students are forced to get good marks in order to get good jobs;</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and as long as teachers want their students to get good marks so that they themselves can gain fame as good teachers, then everything depends on examinations.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It depends on what sort of exams we teachers set and the educational authorities demand.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Until we reform our exams we can hardly reform our teaching methods.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> So let's launch a new campaign, to discuss and reform the exam system; and at the same time continue the campaign against OFIR, the super-power.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We need to fight on two fronts at once.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Otherwise we'll be eggs striking rocks.</T>
