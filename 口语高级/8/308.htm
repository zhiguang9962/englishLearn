      1. We Should All Grow Fat and Be Happy<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a familiar version of the boy-meets-girl 
      situation. A young man has at last plucked up courage to invite a dazzling 
      young lady out to dinner. She has accepted his invitation and he is 
      overjoyed. He is determined to take her to the best restaurant in town, 
      even if it means that he will have to live on memories and hopes during 
      the month to come. When they get to the restaurant, he discovers that this 
      etherial creature is on a diet. She mustn't eat this and she mustn't drink 
      that. Oh, but of course, she doesn' t want to spoil his enjoyment. Lct him 
      by all means eat as much fattening food as he wants: it's the surest way 
      to an early grave. They spend a truly memorable even:ng together and never 
      see each other again.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a miserable lot dieters arel You can always 
      recognize them from the sour expression on their faces. They spend most of 
      their tixne turning their noses up at food. 'They are forever consulting 
      calorie charts; gazing at themselves in mirrors; and leaping on to 
      weighing-machines in the bathroom. They spend a lifetime fighting a losing 
      battle against spreading hips, protruding tummies and double chins Some 
      wage all-out war on fat . Mere dieting is not enough. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">They exhaust 
      themselves doing exercises, sweating in sauna baths, being pummelled and 
      massaged by weird machines. The really wealthy diet-mongers pay vast sums 
      for &quot;health cures? For two weeks they can enter a &quot;nature 
      clinic&quot; and be starved to death for a hundred guineas a week. Don't 
      think it's only the middle-aged who go in for these fads either. Many of 
      these bright young things you see are suffering from chronic malnutrition: 
      they are living on. nothing but air, water and the goodwill of God.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dieters undertake to starve themselves of their own 
      free will so why are they so miserable? Well, for one thing, they're 
      always bungry. You can't be hungry and happy at the same time. All the 
      horrible concoctions they eat instead of food leave, them permanenily 
      dissatisfied. &quot;Wonderfood is a complete food,'~ the advertisement 
      says. &quot;Just dissolve a teaspoonful in water...&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">A complete food 
      it may.be, but not quite as complete as a juicy steak. And, of course, 
      they're always miserable because they feel so guilty. Hunger just proves 
      too much for them and in the end they lash out and devour five huge 
      guilt-inducing cream cakes at a sitting. And who can blame them? At least 
      three times a day they are exposed to temptation. What utter torture it is 
      always watching others tucking into piles of mouth-watering food while you 
      munch a water biscuit and sip unsweetened lemon juice!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's all this self-inflicted torture for? Saintly 
      people deprive themselves of food to attain a state of grace. Unsaintly 
      people do so to attain a state of misery. It will be a great day when all 
      the dieters in the world abandon their slimming courses; when they hold 
      out their plates and demand second helpings!<br>

      2. I Feel Better with Vegetarian Food<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in Texas on double cheeseburgers with hickory 
      sauce, chili, fried. chicken, T-bone steaks, and eggs. Many people report 
      that they lose the taste for animal foods after eating a vegetarian diet 
      for a while, but it hasn't fully happened to me. I still enjoy the way 
      animal foods taste and smell, but I usually don't eat them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not? Because I like the way I feel when I don't eat 
      these foods so much more than the pleasure I used to get from eating them. 
      I have much more energy, I need less sleep, I feel calmer, I can maintain 
      an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat, and I can 
      think more clearly (although some might debate the last point).</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began making some dietary and lifestyle changes 
      during my second year of college and have been eating this way ever since. 
      I wasn't worried about coronary heart disease at age nineteen-my 
      cholesterol levelthen was only 125 (and it still is). I began feeling 
      better after I started eating this way, so I continue to do so. Eating 
      this diet probably will help me to live longer, but it,s not my primary 
      motivation. Feeling better is.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my clinical experience, I often find that fear may 
      be enough motivation<br>
      for some people to begin a diet, but it's usually not enough to sustain 
      it. As I've said earlier, who wants to live longer if you're not enjoying 
      life?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I began making these dietary changes in 1972, 
      eating this way has become increasingly accepted. Beans and grains are 
      becoming, believe it or not, high-status foods.<br>

      3. High-fat Diet, Little Strength<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You bring one of our football players in and put them 
      on a stationary exercise bicycle and tell them to work as hard as they can 
      for as long as they can, and you'll time them. Say the guy lasts for eight 
      minutes, and then he's just exhausted. Then for three days you put him on 
      a high-fat diet. He comes back in, goes on the bike and he'll last 
      probably only six minutes. He's lost that much strength.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then put him on a high carbohydrate, low-fat diet for 
      only three days, and he' 11 probably go up to 12 minutes. It makes that 
      much difference.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. I 
      Feel Great Because I've Lost All That Extra Weight!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my first year of college, I gained forty pounds 
      when I began throwing the javelin. For the next twenty years, I carried 
      all of this extra weight and kidded myself that I was in good shape since 
      that's what I weighed in college. Now that I've lost all that extra 
      weight, I feel great!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People say all the time, &quot;Well, how do you live 
      without eating cheeseburgers or this or that?&quot; and I say, &quot;You 
      just don't. It's not even an option.&quot; It's not that hard once you get 
      on it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most difficult parts for me are the social aspects 
      of eating. For example, hamburgers were hard to do without at first 
      because I identified eating them with fun times-sitting on the floor with 
      the kids watching television, or in a fun place with people sitting around 
      laughing, drinking beer and eating burgers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the same at a tailgate picnic at a football game. 
      It was hard--not because of the foods there, but because of the social 
      factors. But once you understand that, then you can say, &quot;I can enjoy 
      the social part without having to eat that food.&quot; It's more what 
      you're doing than the food itself.</font></p>

      5. Weight Watchers<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jean Nidetch was a professional dieter, a housewife who 
      tried every conceivable .slimming fad, lost weight with each one, then 
      regained it thanks to her habitually &quot;promiscuous?eating habits. In 
      1961, when she sought help from the obesity clinic run by New York City's 
      Dept. of Health, she was 38 years old and weighed 214 lb. The clinic put 
      her on a diet by Dr. Norman Jolliffe, best known.for his &quot;prudent 
      diet&quot;. Convinced that she couldn't stick to it alone, Mrs. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Nidetch invited 
      some fat friends to form a group and meet weekly to made horror stories 
      (secret midnight binging in the bathroom) and helpful hints(put that 
      doughnut in the freezer to cool temptation). Established in 1963, Weight 
      Watchers expanded into an international network of clubs, with a product 
      line of diet drinks, sugar substitutes,and publications-the McDonald's of 
      the reducing industry. &quot;My little private club has become an 
      industry,&quot; wrote Mrs. Nidetch, amateur nutritionist, in The Story of 
      Weight Watchers (1975). In 1978 the oiganization, with about $ 50 million 
      in annual revenues and a cumulative membership of close to 2 million, was 
      bought by Heinz Foods.<br>
