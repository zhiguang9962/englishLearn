<P ALIGN=center><B>2. I Feel Better with Vegetarian Food</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I grew up in Texas on double cheeseburgers with <T TYPE=HOT>hickory</T> sauce, <T TYPE=HOT>chili</T>, fried chicken, T-bone steaks, and eggs. Many people report that they lose the taste for animal foods after eating a vegetarian diet for a while, but it hasn't fully happened to me. I still enjoy the way animal foods taste and smell, but I usually don't eat them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Why not? Because I like the way I feel when I don't eat these foods so much more than the pleasure I used to get from eating them. I have much more energy, I need less sleep, I feel calmer, I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat, and I can think more clearly (although some might debate the last point).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I began making some dietary and lifestyle changes during my second year of college and have been eating this way ever since. I wasn't worried about <T TYPE=HOT>coronary heart disease</T> at age nineteen - my <T TYPE=HOT>cholesterol</T> level then was only 125 (and it still is). I began feeling better after I started eating this way, so I continue to do so. Eating this diet probably will help me to live longer, but it's not my primary motivation. Feeling better is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In my clinical experience, I often find that fear may be enough motivation for some people to begin a diet, but it's usually not enough to sustain it. As I've said earlier, who wants to live longer if you're not enjoying life?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Since I began making these dietary changes in 1972, eating this way has become increasingly accepted. Beans and grains are becoming, believe it or not, high-status foods.<BR>
