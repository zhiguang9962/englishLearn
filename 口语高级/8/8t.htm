<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here is a conversation between a heart specialist and a heart patient.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: I've been feeling very lonely.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I can't explain it, I'm in a crowd but I feel lonely.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And so today, I tried to get in touch with it.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The loneliness and sadness are there because several things are going on.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One, I don't like my body.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Two, I am very angry with my body for having heart disease.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Do you want to do an imagery exercise?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: Yes.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Okay, please close your eyes and put yourself in a meditative state.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If at any time you feel like this is not something you want to do, I'll rely on you to tell me that.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Begin by visualizing your body.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What kind of image do you get?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: Just mounds of flesh. A wall of fat.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Imagine that your body has a voice of its own. Tell it hello.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ask it to just say hello to you, just to identify itself. Does it?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] It says "hello" back. I'm amazed!</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Its voice is different from mine.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Ask it if it has a name.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It says, "Fat."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Ask "Fat" what is its purpose in your life.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] It says, "To give me support. To shield me. To protect me."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Ask it what it is shielding you from.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It says, "From everyone. I'm your best friend."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: In what way is it your friend?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It says, "I've been protecting you."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Ask it what it has been protecting you from.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It says, "You don't have to do a lot of things because you're fat."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Ask it if it's protecting you from anything else.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] Yes, it says it's been protecting me from my feelings.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Okay ¡ª ask it if it's protecting you from any feelings in particular.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] It says, "From loneliness."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: When it says that, do any other images or feelings come to your awareness?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: Somehow I remember getting fat when I was seven.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I see myself going into a room feeling like I was all right, and finding out I was not all right.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So my life has been about justification.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Justification about being all right. Being accepted.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So I used food as a friend.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My fat says it protects me from feeling bad.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have a lot of resistance to change.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have a lot invested in this fat.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And to give it up is like giving up a friend.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's been a barrier but it's also a friend.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's a friend that gets in the way sometimes, but it also serves me really well.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But my size limits me in what I want to do now.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Stay with those feelings now.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ask "Fat" what it needs from you now.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] It says that it needs to be told it's all right the way it is.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Maybe you could start by thanking it for shielding, protecting you from loneliness all these years.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] All right.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Does the wall say anything in reply?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It agrees. It says, "It's about time."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Good. Now ask if it would be willing to open up, to stop shielding you all the time.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you could find a different way to shield yourself when you need it ¡ª one that is easier to open and close.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: A replacement ¡ª is that what you are saying?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Yes. Something that you could use to shield yourself when you need it, but isn't there all the time when you want to open up.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> See what it says.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] It says, "Yes."</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Ask it what you need to do for it to begin opening up.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] To get massaged.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> To be, perhaps, more vulnerable.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> To allow myself to be touched.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: What images or feelings come to mind of your body in that way?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: I'd feel freer.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: How would you look?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ask "Fat", the one that protects you and shields you, if it would give you a different image of your body.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How your body would look if you were more open and less shielded all the time.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: Okay.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: What does it say?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] If I'm willing, it's willing.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Good. What image do you see?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You can always go back to the fat image if you need it.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: I see a thinner body.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: What does it look like?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It looks thinner.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it looks disfigured.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The fat is very disfigured.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: How so?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: It's full of stretch marks. Saggy skin.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Okay. What does that body have to say?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: [pause] To try and attain it anyway. To try to achieve it.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That it's okay to have a thinner body that's not perfect.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Dean: Do any other images or feelings come to your awareness?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Vic: I feel uncomfortable and sad ...</T>
