<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Free Birth Control Techniques Should Be Available Everywhere</B></P><BR>
Matthew: Peter, what sections of the population do you think free birth control techniques should be available to?<BR>
Peter: They should be...available to all sections of the community er ... things are getting to such a pitch that I personally think that ... er ... not only should birth control methods be available to all sections of the community, but indeed should be compulsory. There should be some kind of law which says that a family should not have more than three children, a complete maximum of three children, if they have three children then they must be obliged by law, almost, to use birth control, if not have er ... various kinds of operation which ... um ... make conception impossible.<BR>
Matthew: But surely this is very er ... explosive in social terms?<BR>
Peter: It's very ... it's a very <T TYPE=HOT>totalitarian</T> <T TYPE=HOT>notion</T>, but the alternative ... if we look around us in the world outside is millions of people starving to death in places like India, and people suffering from malnutrition in...in other parts of the underdeveloped wor...world and indeed even in parts of the dev ... so called developed world.<BR>
