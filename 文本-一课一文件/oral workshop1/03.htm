      <strong>There Is Something Very Nice Inside Your Drum</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Jimmy's birthday, and he was five years old. He  
      got quite a lot of nice birthday presents from his family, and one of them  
      was a beautiful big drum.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Who gave him that thing?&quot; Jimmy's father  
      said when he saw it.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His grandfather did,&quot; answered Jimmy's  
      mother.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh,&quot; said his father.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course , Jimmy liked his drum very much. He made a  
      terrible noise witb it, but his mother did not mind. His father was  
      working during the day, and Jimmy was in bed when he got home in the  
      evening, so he did not hear the noise.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one of the neighbours did not like the noise at all  
      , so one morning a few days later, she took a sharp knife and went to  
      Jimmy's house while he was hitting his drum. She said to him, &quot;Hullo,  
      Jimmy. Do you know, there's something very nice inside your drum. Here's a  
      knife. Open the drum and let's find it. &quot;</font></p>

      <br> 
      <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The police in the big city were looking for  
      a thief. At last they caught him. But while they were taking photographs  
      of him - from the front, from the left, from the right, with a hat,  
      without a hat - he suddenly attacked the policemen and ran off. They tried  
      to catch him, but he got away.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a week later the telephone rang in the  
      police-station, and somebody said, &quot;You are looking for Bill Cross,  
      aren't you?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, he left here for Waterbridge an hour ago.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waterbridge was a small town about 100 miles from the  
      city. The city police at ence sent four different photographs of the thief  
      to the police in Waterbridge.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than twelve hours later they got a telephone call  
      from the police in Waterbridge. &quot;We have caught the fourth this  
      evening, we think. &quot;</font></p>
