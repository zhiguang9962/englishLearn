      Give Me a Big Box of Chocolates</font></strong></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John liked chocolates very much, but his mother  
      never gave him any, because they were bad for his teeth, she thought. But  
      .)ohn had a very nice grandfather. The old man loved his grandaon very  
      much, and sometimes he brought John chocolates when he. came to visit him.  
      Then his mother let him eat them, because she wanted to make the old man  
      happy.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening , a few days before John's seventh birthday  
      , he was saying his prayers in his bedroom before he went to bed.  
      &quot;Please, God,&quot; he shouted, &quot;make them give me a big box of  
      chocolates for my birthday on Saturday. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother was in the kitchen, but she heard the small  
      boy shouting and went into his bedroom quickly.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why are you shouting, John?&quot; she asked her  
      son. &quot;God can hear you when you talk quietly. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know,&quot; answered the clever boy with a  
      smile, &quot;but Grandfather's in the next room, and he can't. &quot;</font></p>

      You Are Too Young to Buy Alcohol<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that day, Steve told the group that he had  
      decided to go back to Edinburgh. &quot;I want to see the rest of the  
      Festival, &quot; he explained. That evening, they all went to a pub for a  
      final drink with Steve. They left a . message for Malc : GONE TO THE WHITE  
      HORSE. SEE YOU THERE!<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malc arrived back quite late. He went round to the pub  
      immediately. He was feeling very pleased with himself.<br> 
      &nbsp; BILL: How did it go, then?<br> 
      &nbsp; MALC: Oh, fantastic! I took some really good photographs. I'm sure  
      I shall win that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; competition.<br> 
      &nbsp; LIsE: Well , you'd better buy us all a drink , then !<br> 
      &nbsp; MALC: Yes... What would you all like?<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Malc goes to the bar)<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like four pints of best bitter...  
      oh, and two lagers and lime.<br> 
      BARMAN: ... Oh, excuse me, sir. How old are you?<br> 
      &nbsp; MALC: Sixteen. Why?<br> 
      BARMAN: Well, I'm afraid you're too young to buy alcohol. You have to be  
      eighteen, you know.<br>

      Question on Text B</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      <br>
      7. Read the following passage once. Underline the key words while reading  
      and retell the atory to your partner.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An artist went to a beautiful part of the country for a  
      holiday, and stayed with a farmer. Every day he went out with his paints  
      and his brushes and painted from morning to evening, and then when it got  
      dark, he went back to the farm and had a good dinner before he went to  
      bed.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of his holiday he wanted to pay the farmer,  
      but the farmer said, &quot;No, I do not want money - but give me one of  
      your pictures. What is money? In a week it will all be finished, but your  
      painting will still be here. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The artist was very pleased and thanked the farmer for  
      saying such kind things about his paintings.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The farmer smiled and answered, &quot;It is not that. I  
      have a son in London. He wanta to become an artist. When he comes here  
      next month, I will show him your picture, and then he will not want to be  
      an artist any more, I think. &quot;</font></td>
