      was very angry with her husband. For several days they did not speak to  
      each other at a11. One evening Mr Jones was very tired when he came back  
      from work, so he went to bed soon after dinner. Of course , he did not say  
      anything to Mrs Jones before he went upstairs. Mrs Jones washed the dinner  
      things and then did some sewing. When she went up to bed much later than  
      her husband, she found a piece of aper on the small table near her bed. On  
      it were the words,&quot;Mother. - Wake me up at 7 a. m. -Father&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mr Jones woke up the next morning, it was nearly 8  
      a. m. -and on the small table near his bed he saw another piece of paper.  
      He took it and read these words: &quot;Father. - Wake up. It is 7  
      a.m.-Mother. &quot;<br>

      made her feel that she had to help tbings grow. She gathered her tools and  
      went to the patch of freshly turned earth and began.to dig rows of holes.  
      Then she carefully picked up one fragile plant and ptaced it in a hole.
