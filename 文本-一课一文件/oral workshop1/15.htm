      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose left school when she was seventeen  
      and went to a college for a year to learn to type. She passed her  
      examinations quite well and then went to look for work. She was still  
      living with her parents.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of people were looking for typists at that time,  
      so it was not difficult to find interesting work. Rose went to several  
      offices, and then chose one of them. It was near her parents' house. She  
      thought, &quot;I'll walk there every morning. I won't need to go by bus.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to the office again and said to the manager,  
      &quot;I want to work here, but what will you pay me?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We'll pay you 27 pounds now,&quot; the manager  
      answered, &quot;and 30 pounds after three months.&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose thought for a few seconds before she answered.  
      Then she said, &quot;All right, then I'll start in three months' time.

      What a Language!<br>

      </font> 
      </strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Frenchman: I once heard someone shout,  
      &quot;Look out.&quot; I put my head out of a window and a bucketful of  
      water fsll on me. It seems that &quot;look out&quot; may mean &quot;don't  
      look out. &quot;<br> 
      Second F: I was once on a ship and heard the captain shout, &quot;All  
      hands on deck. &quot; I put my hands on the deck and someone walked on  
      them. .<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third F: I once called early on an English friend and  
      the maid who came to the door said, &quot;He's not up yet. Come back in  
      half an hour. &quot; When I went again for him, she said, &quot;He's not  
      down yet. &quot; I said , &quot;If he's not up and he's not down, where is  
      he?&quot; She said, &quot;He's still in bed. When I say 'He's not up' I  
      mean he has not yet got np,so he has not yet come downstairs.&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do these phrases mean in their respective  
      contexts?</font></p>
