      The Coustry Schoollhouse<br> 
      </font> 
      </strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The country schooihouse was three miles from  
      my uncle's farm. It stood in a clearing in the woods and would hold about  
      twenty-five boys and girls. We attended the school° with more or less  
      regularity once or twice a week in summer. We walked to it in the cool of  
      the morning by the forest paths, and</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;back in the dusk at the end of the  
      day. All the pupils brought their dinners in baskets-corn dodger,  
      buttermilk, and other good things. We sat in the shade of the trees at  
      noon and ate them. It is the part of my education which I look back upon  
      with the most satisfaction. My first visit to the school was</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;when I was  
      seven. A strapping girl of fifteen, in the customary sunbonnet and calico  
      dress, asked me if I &quot;used tobacco&quot; -meaning did I chew it. I  
      said no. It roused her scorn. She reported me to all the crowd , and said  
      :<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here is a boy seven years old who can't chew  
      tobacco. &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned to smoke fairly well , but that did not win  
      over anybody. I remained a poor thing, and characterless. I longed to be  
      respected, but I never was able to rise. Children have but little charity  
      for one another's defect.</font></p>
