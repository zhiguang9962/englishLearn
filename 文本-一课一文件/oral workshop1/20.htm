      Honesty<br> 
      </font> 
      </strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man went to an insurance office to have his  
      life insured.<br> 
      The manager of the office asked him how old his parents .were when they  
      died.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mother had a bad heart and died at the age of  
      thirty. Father died of tuberculosis when he was thirty-five. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am very sorry,&quot; said the manager, &quot;We  
      cannot insure your life as your parents were not healthy. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the man was leaving the office, depressed, he met a  
      elerk who had overheard the conversation.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You must not be so frank and tell the  
      truth,&quot; said the clerk, &quot;no office will insure you if you speak  
      like that. Use your imagination a little. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man went to another office and was shown into the  
      manager's room.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, young man, how old were your parents when  
      they died?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mother was ninety-three, and she died from a fall  
      off her bicycle. Father was ninety-eight and he died while he was playing  
      football. &quot;</font></p>

      </strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Williams loved flowers and had a small but  
      beautiful garden. In the summer, her roses were always the best in her  
      street. One summer afternoon her bell rang, and when she went to the front  
      door, she saw a small boy outside. He was about seven years old,,and was  
      holding a big bunch of beautiful roses in his hand.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am selling roses&quot;, he said. &quot;Do you want  
      any? They are quite cheap. Five pence for a big bunch. They are fresh. I  
      picked them this afternoon. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My boy,&quot;Mrs Williams answered, &quot;I pick roses  
      whenever I want, and don't pay anything for them, because I have lots in  
      my garden. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh , no , you haven't , &quot; said the small boy.  
      &quot;There aren't any roses in your garden - because t.hey are here in my  
      hand!&quot;</font></p>
