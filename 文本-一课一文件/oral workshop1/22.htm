      <strong>If I Don't Do Anything Else</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday morning Paul said to himself. &quot;I've got  
      to write that economics paper today. If I don't do anything else, I've got  
      to write that paper. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down at his desk and put a sheet. of paper into  
      his typewriter. He looked out of the window, ate a piece of candy, got up  
      to get a drink of water, brushed his teeth, and sat down at his desk  
      again.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I haven't written my family since  
      Thanksgiving,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I'll write them a letter  
      first. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul wrote his family a long letter. &quot;My  
      typewriter needs a new ribbon. I've got to change this ribbon before I  
      write my<br> 
      economics paper.&quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ink from the typewriter ribbon got his hands very  
      dirty, so he washed them and washed them. While he was washing his hands,  
      he noticed that his fingernails were much too long. He cut them very  
      carefully and then went back to his desk. He put a sheet of paper into his  
      typewriter . looked out of the wiudow, and looked at his watch. It was  
      noon.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll get some lunch now,&quot;.he said to  
      himself. &quot;After lunch I'll write that paper, if I don't do anything  
      else. &quot;<br>

      <strong>A Break in the Routine</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jonathan Rivers lived alone in a neat, two-storey,  
      semi-detached house<br> 
      in Compton Street. Like many bachelors approaching middle age, be was  
      getting rather set in his ways. He caught the same train to London every  
      morning, ate his lunch in the same crowded restaurant near the office  
      where he worked and always came home on the 6. 00 train. People were so  
      used to seeing Jonathan set off at a quarter past eight, dressed in a.  
      sjmple dark suit. wearing a black bowler hat and carrying a rolled  
      umbrella on his arm, that they said you didn't need to wear a watch if you  
      lived in Compton Street.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since Jonathan had set up house in Compton Street,  
      he had looked after it very carefully. He worked hard in the garden every  
      Sunday and set out to impress the neighbours with his flower beds and  
      lawn. Before he left the house in the mornings, he carefully closed all  
      the doors downstairs, opened some windows to let the air in and locked the  
      front door. Everything Jonathan did was tidy and systematic.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One summer evening Jonathan returned home as usual at  
      five minutes to seven precisely.When he opened the front gate he  
      immediately noticed something strange. There was a heavy footprint in the  
      earth in one of the ftower beds. Jonathan was just going to blame the  
      milkman or the postman when he noticed that one of the white lace curtains  
      in the front room downstairs was out of place. Jonathan never left  
      anything out of place.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked up to the front door and opened it quietly.  
      He listened carefully for a few moments but could hear nothing. The  
      front-room door was halt-open. Jonathan studied it thoughtfully, wondering  
      if he had forgotten to close it that morning. He had never forgotten  
      before. He stepped silently across the hall to the door and looked inside  
      the room. The shadow of a man was clearly reflected on the far wall in the  
      evening sunlight. He had obvioasly been standing behind the door since  
      Jonathan's return. ]onathan grabbed the door-handle, sla;nmed' the door  
      and turned the key. Then he calmly picked up the telephone in the hall and  
      set about calling the police.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burglar, a tall, thick-set, bearded fellow, tried  
      to climb through a window to get out but )onathan had expected'that. He  
      set about him with his umbrella, using it like a swoid. Three minutes  
      later the police arrived on the scene. Jonathan was a little annoyed that  
      he had to have dinner laterthan usual but on the whole he felt quite  
      pleased with himself.<br>
