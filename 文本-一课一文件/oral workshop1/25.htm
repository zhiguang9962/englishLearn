      A Ten-Dollar Bill</strong></font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam waited patiently in the long line at the grocery  
      store. He had come to pick up a few items for his mother. He often did  
      Chores for his parents after school. He enjoyed helping out at Homes, As  
      he waited, he daydreamed about the new camera he Wanted to buy. He wanted  
      to buy it soon because his family v'as ;oing on a vacation, and he wanted.  
      to take pictures of their trip. There was only one problem. He needed  
      seven more dollars to huy the camera. His lawn-mowing job at the Smith's  
      should provide the money shortly.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly Sam was roughly shoved aside. He recognized  
      Mrs Sanders, an unkind and unfriendly person who lived on his block. She  
      had shoved in front of him without even smiling. Just as Mrs Sanders  
      received her change and her purchases, a ten-dollar bill flew out of her  
      hand and fell at Sam's feet. Mrs Sanders, however, was too busy  
      criticizing the cashier for bis slowness to notice. As Sam bent to pick up  
      the money, he thought quickly. The money did belong to Mrs Sanders, but  
      she deserved to lose it after the way she had behaved, and, with it, he  
      could buy the camera.</font></p>

      and retell the story to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Green was very fat. She weighed 100 kilos, and she  
      was getting heavier every month , so she went to see her doctor. , He  
      said, &quot;You need a diet, Miss Green, and I've got a good one here.  
      &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave her a small book and said, &quot;Read this  
      carefully and eat the things on page 11 every day. Then come back and see  
      me in two weeks' time. &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Green came again two weeks later, but she wasn't  
      thinner; she was fatter. The doctor was surprised and said, &quot;Are you  
      eating the things on page 11 of the small book?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes , doctor , she answered.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day the doctor visited Miss Green during her  
      dinner. She was very surprised to see him.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Miss Green,&quot; he said, &quot;Why are you  
      eating potatoes and bread? They aren't in your diet. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But, doctor,&quot; Miss Green answered, &quot;I  
      ate my diet at lunch time. This is my dinner.</font></p>
