      <strong>What Are the Times of Meals?</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Williams had always spent their summer  
      holidays<br> 
      in England in the past , in a small boarding-house at the seaside. One  
      year, however, Mr Williams made a lot of money in his business , so they  
      decided to go to Rome and stay at a really good hotel while they went  
      around and saw the sights of that famous city.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They flew to Rome, and arrived at their hotel late one  
      evening. They expected that they would have to go to bed hun- gry, because  
      in the boarding-houses they had been used to in the past, no meals were  
      served after seven o'clock in the evening. They were therefore surprised  
      when the clerk who received them in the hall of the hotel asked them  
      whether they would be taking dinner there that night.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you still serving dinner then?&quot; asked  
      Mrs Williams.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, certainly, madam,&quot; answered the clerk.  
      &quot;We serve it until half-past nine. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What are the times of meals then?&quot; asked Mr  
      Williams.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, sir,&quot; answered the clerk, &quot;we  
      serve breakfast from seven to half-past eleven in the morning, lunch from  
      twelve to three in the afternoon, tea from four to five, and dinner from  
      six to half-past nine. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the  
      sights of' Rome ! &quot; said Mrs Williams in a disappointed voice.</font></p>
