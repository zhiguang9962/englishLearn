      Where to Find a Listener<br> 
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Adamson enjoys playing the violin in his  
      leisure time. He is often carried away by his music. But it is a terrible  
      time for his neighbours when Mr Adamson plays as he does so badly.<br> 
      One day Mr Adamson sat by a window and began te play the violin as usual.  
      Mr Adamson seems to be making noises instead of music. However, Mr Adamson  
      was absorbed. Just then, some stones</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;were thrown out of the window under  
      which Mr Adamson was sitting, but he did not pay attention to it. The  
      &quot;music&quot; continued. After a little while, an empty bottle and a  
      worn-out shoe were thrown out of the window too. Mr Adamson knew that this  
      was not the place for him. The neighbours did not like his &quot;music  
      &quot;. Mr Adamson was very sad. He was badly hurt. &quot;Perhaps no  
      living people can understand my music.I should go to a place where people  
      may appreciate my works. &quot; So he decided to go to a graveyard.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to a graveyard where there was no other sound  
      ex cept the church to11. The yard was a Heaven'&quot; where dead people<br> 
      rest. Mr Adamson sat at a grave's and thought a lot, &quot;I must do my  
      best to show that my music is outstanding. &quot; He was inspired and  
      began to play his violin. Suddenly a barefoot stretched out from the grave  
      amd gave Mr Adamson a kick which sent him flying. His treasured violin  
      also dropped frum his hand. Mr Adamson felt very sad because his works was  
      not accepted by anyone , not even the dead.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman each owed a  
      friend of theirs a pound. The man died. They agreed that their debts were  
      debts of honour and must be paid, and that each one should go to the dead  
      man's house, leave a pound and ask that it should be buried with him, as  
      he had no relatives. The Englishman went and left a pound; so did the  
      Irishman. The Scotsman went to the house, took the two pounds, wrote a  
      cheque for three pounds and asked that it should be buried with the dead  
      man.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the undertaker (the man who arranges funerals) was  
      a Welshman. He found the cheque, cashed it and kept the money.<br>
