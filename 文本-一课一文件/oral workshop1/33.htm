      The Stolen Smells</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years ago in another country there lived a poor  
      student.He had vcry little money. He lived in a very small room over a  
      restaurant? His room was at the back of the building over the kitchen. The  
      restaurant owner was a very mean man. Nobody liked him. But he was a good  
      cook and many people came to his restaurant.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day he was working quietly in his kitchen when he  
      heard the poor student talking to his friend.&quot;You must be very  
      unhappy, said his friend, `living in a poor room like this.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh no.&quot; said the student, &quot;I am busy  
      with my studies and I'm not interested in my room.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But you only cat plain rice - you don't have  
      money for anything tasty &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, it's true, I eat only plain rice. But the  
      delicious smells that come from the kitchen make thc rice very tasty  
      indeed. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant owner was furious. This student was  
      stealing the smells from his kit.chen. He decided to tatke him to court.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody in the court laughed whcn the me; n man  
      accuset thc student of stealing hi.s smells'. But thc judge took him  
      seriously.&quot;Every man should be able to complain to the court .&quot;  
      he said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the restaurant owvner told the judgc everything.  
      the judge said , &quot;You are right. The student is guiltv. &quot; The  
      reataurant owner waa delighted, but the poor student was vcry much .  
      afraid. What could he do? He had only a few coina in his pocket.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge asked the studcnt if he had any money. The  
      student took 5 coins from his pockct and held them out to the judge in his  
      right hand.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let the coins fall into your left hand,&quot;  
      said the judge.<br> 
      The courtroom was very quiet. Everyone heard the tinkle of the coins as  
      they fell into the student's left hand.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well,&quot; said the judge to the restaurant  
      owner, &quot;you've heard his money. You've been well paid for your  
      smells. &quot;<br>

      <strong>A Bad Student</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter's father wants to know how his son is getting  
      along in school. One day he asks him;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Peter, how are you getting along in school? What  
      seat do you have in the class? Does the teacher place you in seats  
      according to your marks?&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, father. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And what seat do you have?&quot; &quot;Number  
      twenty-one. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And how many students are there in your  
      class?&quot; &quot;Twenty-one, father. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several weeks pass. Peter, who is a bad student and  
      studies very little, brings home the marks of his monthly examinations.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How are you getting along in school now,  
      Peter?&quot; asks his father. &quot;Your marks do not seem to be very  
      good. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am getting along much better now, father.  
      &quot; &quot;What is your place in the class now?&quot;&nbsp;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Number twenty now. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Good. Then you are one place ahead. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, father. One of the students left the class.  
      His family moved to another town. &quot;<br>
