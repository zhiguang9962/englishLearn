      Stage Fright</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom was sick with disappointment. The piano recital  
      ha.d turned out well, all except for his solo. He couldn't understand how  
      it could have happened.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had practised for weeks that seemed like months. He  
      had given up sports until after the recital because he wanted to make his  
      parents proud of him. He spent all his time with the pi</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His teacher had said he was gifted. It was true that he  
      accepted music as another language, another way to talk to people.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grandparents, aunt, and uncle all came to hear him  
      play, and he was anxious to show them that he was the best in the whole  
      class.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, when he stood up to go to the piano, his knees  
      felt weak. He looked into the audience and saw his family smiling back at  
      him.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mouth went dry. His fingers began to tremble. The  
      trembling became uncontrollable shaking as though he had caught a bad  
      cold.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down at the piano. He took a deep breath. He  
      played the first five bars of his music , then realized with horror that  
      he had forgotten thc rest. He started over. thinking that would help. It  
      didn't.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood up as if in slow motion and walked offf the st  
      age. He was a failure. The demon stage fright had left a brilliant musical  
      career in ruins.</font></p>

      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a dark day when we got our report cards Thesky  
      was full of gray clouds and it was sprinkling rain. I was over to Clyde's  
      house and Gloria and Kitty were there. Sam probably would hade been there,  
      too, only he had got a two-week job in the afternoons helping out at  
      Freddie's. actually he only did it so that his mother would let him be on  
      the track team again. Sam and his mother had this little system going He  
      would do something<br> 
      good-doing and she'd let him do something that he wanted to.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clyde's report card was on the kitchen table and we all  
      sat around it like it was some kind of a big important document. I had got  
      a pretty good report card and had wanted to show it off but I knew it  
      wasn't the time. Clyde pushed the card toward me and I read it. He had all&nbsp;  
      satisfactory remarks on the side labeled Personal Traits and Behavior. He  
      had also received B's in . music and art appreciation. But everything else  
      was either a C or a D except mathematics. His mathematics mark was a big  
      red F that had been circled. I don't know why they had to circle the F  
      when it was the only red mark on the card. In the Teacher's Comments  
      section someone had written that Clyde had &quot;little ability to handle  
      an academic program. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A little ability is better than none,&quot; I  
      said. No one said anything so I figured it probably wasn't the right. time  
      to try to cheer Clyde up.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew all about his switching from a commercial  
      program to an academic program, but I really hadn't thought he'd have any  
      trouble.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I saw the grade adviser today. He said I should  
      switch back to the commercial program. &quot; Clyde looked like he'd start  
      crying any minute. His eyes were red and his voice was shaky. &quot;He  
      said that I had to take mathematics over and if I failed again or failed  
      another required subject 1 couldn't graduate. The way it is now I'm going  
      to have to finish up in the summer because I switched over. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think you can pass it if you really want  
      to,&quot; Kitty said. Clyde's sister was so pretty I couldn't even look at  
      her. If I did, I started feeling funny and couldn't talk right. Sometimes  
      I daydreamed about marrying her.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then Clyde's mother came in and he gave a quick  
      look at Kitty.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hi, young ladies and young gentlemen. &quot; Mrs.  
      Jones was a kind of heavy woman but she was pretty, too. You could tell  
      she was Kitty's mother if you looked close. She put her packagege down and  
      started taking things out. &quot;I heard you pcople talking whcas I first  
      came in. By the way you hushed up I guess you don't want me to hear what  
      you were talking about. I'll be out of your way in a minute, soon as I put  
      the frozen foods in the refrigerator. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I got my report card today,&quot; Clyde said. His  
      mother stopped taking<br> 
      the food out and turned toward us. Clyde pushed the report card about two  
      inches toward her. She really didn't even have to look at the card to know  
      that it was bad. She could have told that just by looking at Clyde. But  
      she picked it up and looked' at it a long time. First she looked at one  
      side and then the other and then back at t.he first side again.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What they say around the school?&quot; she asked,  
      still looking at the card. &quot;They said I should drop the academic  
      course and go back to the other one. &quot; I could hardly hear Clyde , he  
      spoke so low.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, what are you going to do, young man She  
      looked u at Clyde and Clyde looked up at her and there were tears in his  
      eyes and I almost started crying. I can't stand to see my friends cry.  
      &quot;What are you going to do, Mr. Jones?&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm -I'm going to keep the academic course,&quot;  
      Clyde said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You think it's going to be any easier this  
      time?&quot; Mrs.Jones asked.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Things ain't always easy. Lord knows that things  
      ain't always easy. &quot; For a minute there was a faraway look in her  
      eyes, but then her face turned into a big smile. &quot;You're just like  
      your father, boy. That man never would give up on anything he really  
      wanted. Did I ever tell you the time he was trying to learn to play the  
      trombone?&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No. &quot;Clyde still had tears in his eyes but  
      he was smiling, too. Suddenly everybody was happy. It was like seeing a  
      rainbow when it was still raining.<br>
