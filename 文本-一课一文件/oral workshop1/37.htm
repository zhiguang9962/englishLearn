      <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
      Do You Know Who I Am?<br> 
      </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Smith is well known in Washington because  
      of his many social blunders. He alwavs likes to attend the various social  
      functions because he wants to expand his circle of friend. Whenever he is  
      invited , he goes , unless he is ill.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently he received an invitation to a fashionable  
      banquet. Although he did not know the hostess, he accepted the invitation.  
      He was secretly very pleased, because he felt that his reputation as a  
      desirable guest was growing.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he arrived. at the banquet hall, he found that  
      about one hundred people had been invited. He began to move around the  
      hall. He spoke to other guests whether he knew them or not. He soon  
      realized that he had never met any of the other people present, although  
      they seemed to know each other.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dinner, he was seated beside a very dignified woman.  
      The woman tried to be friendly even though she had never met Mr Smith  
      before. She spoke politely, whenever he spoke to her. Between the first  
      and second course of the meal , she turned to Mr Smith and said, &quot;Do  
      you see that gray-haired man at the end of the table? The one with the  
      glasses. &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ah, yes. Who is he?&quot; asked Mr Smith.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He's the Secretary of the Interior!&quot; she  
      replied.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Smith said: &quot;So that's the Secretary of the  
      Interior! I'm afraid that I find very little to admire about him, although  
      he is the Secretary. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman stiffened and did not reply. Smith continued  
      in spite of her coldness. &quot;I really can't see how he received his  
      appointment, unless he is perhaps a relative of the President. &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It hardly matters whether you like the Secretary  
      of not,&quot; she said. &quot;He was chosen because the President thought  
      he was the man for the job If he does the job well, you should have no  
      complairit. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's just it,&quot;persisted Smith. &quot;No  
      one does the things he does , unless he is a complete fool ! &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sir! &quot;said the woman in all her dignity.  
      &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; replied Smith.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am the Secretary's wife, &quot;she said coldly.  
      Mr Smith was flabbergasted, but he went on in spite of his embarrassment.  
      &quot;Madam, do you know who I am?&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, I don't,&quot; the woman replied.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thank goodness! &quot;exclaimed Mr Smith, as he  
      quickly left the table.<br>

      Question on Text B</font></strong></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">7. Read the following passage once. Underline the key words while  
      reading and retell the story to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry D. Penrose was a dog with a pedigree. He lived in  
      a fine stone house with white marble steps and red velvet drapes on every  
      window.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His owner, Professor Randolph Penrose, was quite rich.  
      Each morning Henry was driven to Obedience School in a long black  
      limousine. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each afternoon he was fed two grilled lamb chops for  
      lunch.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each evening he fell asleep in his fur-lined basket in  
      front of the fire- place.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturdays he was groomed at Miss Fifi's Shop. And on  
      Sundays he accompanied the professor to the park, where a classical  
      orchestra played soothing music and the grass was cool and fragrant.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Penrose would stroke Henry's shiny coat and  
      say, &quot;You have the life, Henry my boy!&quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Henry certainly had to agree.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one day it all changed. Just. Like. That.  
      professor Penrose received a telegram offering him a chance to dig for  
      dinosaur bones in Idaho. For one entire year.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one problem. The telegram stated quite  
      firmly in the largest letters possible: NO PETS ALLOWED!</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cook, Mrs Washburn, agreed to take Henry to her  
      home until the professor returned.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Penrose hated to send Henry to live on the  
      other side of the city. There were no marble steps or red velvet drapes on  
      Mrs Washburn's property.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Henry was buttoned into his red plaid coat and  
      driven to the Washburn residence.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry stepped out of the limousine. He was so shocked  
      that his ears stuck out like two car doors.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an untidy home he had never seen. It was all he  
      could do to maintain a sense of dignity.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was picking his way through the toys on the muddy  
      front steps when a tumble of children spilled onto the porch, scooped him  
      up, and before you could say&quot;One-two&quot;Henry was deposited in a  
      sea of soap bubbles in the Washburn bathtub.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time he tried to jump out, little hands pushed him  
      back in. &quot;Don't be too rough, children,&quot; said Mrs Washburn.  
      &quot;Henry isn't used to such fun. &quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner that evening was a big steamy ham bone. Bits of  
      cabbage fell from it as one of the children tossed it from the pot to  
      Henry. What! thought Henry. No plate?<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wondered if he'd ever see a grilled lamb chop again.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By bedtime, Henry was exhausted. His fur-lined basket  
      had been left behind. Where would he sleep?</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then two of the children carried him off to a room  
      with three bunk beds.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Henry's sleeping with me ! &quot; announced one  
      child , pulling him to one bunk.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh no! Henry's sleeping with me!&quot; protested  
      another, yanking him toward another bunk.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third child elbowed his way in, and Henry flopped to  
      the floor.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he could crawl under one of the beds, a pillow  
      fight broke out.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thwack! A pillow smacked into Henry's face. He barked.  
      Loud!<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Washburn came scurrying down the hallway. The  
      children scattered into their beds.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why, Henry!&quot; scolded Mrs Washburn. &quot;You  
      never barked like that before! Quiet down, or the children will never get  
      to sleep!&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday there was no park or classical orchestra. No  
      cool and fragrant grass. Just the Washburn's backyard with its dandelion  
      clumps and creaky swings and a fort made out of empty cardboard boxes.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children wrestled with Henry. They scratched his  
      ears and tied an old red Christmas ribbon around his neck. They tried to  
      make him chase the cat next door. Baby Washburn even kissed him-a big,  
      sloppy, wet, strawberry-lollipop kiss , right on the nose.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, when Baby toppled over onto Henry's tail, they  
      both cried: &quot;<br> 
      &quot;Yeeeeooooooow !<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Washburn poked her head out of the back door.  
      &quot;Don't hurt Baby, Henry. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days, weeks, months passed.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry learned to put up with pillow fights and  
      strawberry kisses. He learned to ignore the neighbour's cat and to wriggle  
      Christmas ribbons off<br> 
      his neck. He even learned to eat steamy ham bones.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then one day everything changed. Just. Like. That.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Penrose returned. ,<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long black limousine came to take Henry back to the  
      professor's fine stone house.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Washburn children gathered on their front porch.  
      Tears streamed down their cheeks. &quot;Good-bye, Henry,&quot; they  
      sniffled sadly. &quot;Good-bye!&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, after being groomed by Miss Fifi (who  
      kept sighing over the tangles in his coat) and after being fed two plump,  
      perfectly grilled lamb chops (in his own monogrammed dish), Henry climbed  
      into his furlined basket in front of the fireplace.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He yawned. He laid his head on his front paws. He  
      closed his eyes.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did not go to sleep.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something was wrong. Everything was so quiet, so  
      peaceful. Too quiet. Too peaceful.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry climbed out of his basket. He nudged open the  
      front door and headed down the road to the Washburn house. At first he  
      walked properly, as he had been taught. Then he ran.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he arrived, he scratched at the door.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Washburn opened it. &quot;Why, it's you, Henry.  
      Welcome home!&quot; Henry dashed up the stairs and into the children's  
      bedroom. It was dark.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thwack! A pillow smacked into his face.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry ducked under one of the beds. He smelled the  
      faint scent of strawberry, and as he drifted off to sleep, he was thinking  
      to himself; You have the life, Henry my boy. You have the life.<br>
