      <strong>My Father's Son</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard being an astronaut's son. I mean, everybody  
      expects you to be special or perfect, and I'm just an average elevenyear-old  
      kid. I'm an average student, and I'm average, too, when it comes to  
      basketball, football, soccer, and baseball.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often wonder how my father ever had a son like me. I  
      mean he's so special and so good at everything he does. In high school he  
      was captain of the football team, class president, and editor of the  
      school newspaper.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, to tell you the truth,I do have a little talent  
      that nobody knows about. I write poems and stories and keep them in a red  
      notebook in my bottom desk drawer.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays I dream about being a famous writer, but I  
      used to dream about doing something spectacular to impress my father and  
      make him proud of me-something like rescuing a child from a burning  
      building or chasing a robber away from an old lady.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was daydreaming in school one morning ( which I do  
      often). I was daydreaming about being some kind of hero, like discovering  
      an instant cure for cancer or a shot for mental illness, when I heard my  
      English teacher announce a Father's Day essay contest for the whole  
      school.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I hope we have a winner right here in my English  
      class,</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      she said. &quot;The PTA has donated three cash prizes- one hundred dollars  
      for first prize, fifty dollars for second, and twenty-five dollars for  
      third prize. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After school I walked home, thinking about the essay I  
      would write. My father is an astronaut, I would start out. No, I decided.  
      I wouldn't do that. The whole country and maybe even the whole world saw  
      my father as an astronaut , but that wasn't the way I saw him.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Igot home, I kissed my mom quickly. Then I went  
      upstairs to my room and sat down with a pen and a pad of paper. I started  
      to think about what I would write.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did I see my father. Hmm.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him sitting with me in the dark23 when I was a  
      little kid and had a nightmare.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him teaching me how to use a bat and how to throw  
      a baseball.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered how he hugged me for hours when my dog  
      Spotty was hit and killed by a car.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I remembered how he surprised me with a new puppy  
      at my eighth birthday party. When I started to cry, he told all the kids  
      that I had a bad allergy. &quot;David's allergy bothers him a lot this  
      time of year,&quot; Dad said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I remembered how he sat and tried to explain death  
      to me when Grandpa Bob died.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were the things I was going to write about my  
      dad. To me, he wasn't just a world-famous astronaut. He was my dad.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote about all these memories and put them in my  
      essay. I handed it in the next day and was surprised to find out that the  
      winning essays would be read in the auditorium on Thursday night. A11 the  
      parents and students were invited.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents and I went to school Thursday night. One of  
      our neighbours said, &quot;I bet you'll win the contest, David. I bet you  
      wrote what it's like to be the son of an astronaut, and you're the only  
      one in town who could write about that. &quot;</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad looked at me, and I shrugged. I hadn't sliown  
      him the essay, and now I almost hoped Lwouldn't win. I didn't want; to win  
      just because my father was an astronaut.<br> 
      When third prize was announced and it wasn't me, I was relieved and  
      disappointed at the same time, Ellen Gordon won third prize, and she read  
      her essay. Ellen. is adopted, and she wrote a.bout her &quot;better than  
      real&quot; father. When she got to the end,I heard people in the audience  
      sniffing and blowing their noses. My mother sniffed, and my father cleared  
      his throat.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second-prize winner was announced next. It was me.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went up to the stage, my knees shaking. I read my  
      essay and wondered if my voice was shaking, too. It was scary standing up  
      in front of all those people. I called my essay &quot;My Father's Son.  
      &quot; I watched my parents as I read. When I finished reading, the  
      audience applauded. I saw my father blowing his nose. Tears were running  
      down my mother's face. I went back<br> 
      to my seat.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I see you have an allergy , too , Dad , &quot; I  
      tried to joke.<br> 
      Dad nodded, cleared his throat, and put his hand on my shoulder.  
      &quot;Son, this is the proudest moment of my life,&quot; he said.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the proudest moment of my life, too. Maybe I'll  
      never be a great hero or win a Nobel Prize, but just then, it was enough  
      just to be my father's son.</font></p>

      The Clever Servant</strong><br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago, there was a rich old man who loved  
      wine and<br> 
      food above everything else. And he had a servant who loved drinking and  
      eating as much as his master did.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time the rich old man went out, he had to hide his  
      wine and food away. Bot each time the servant found them and he helped  
      himself to the bottles of wine and all the nice food. Of course, the rich  
      old man knew who did it and was displeased. But he could do neth:ag about  
      it, because he had never caught his servant drinking his wine or eating  
      his food.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day the old man was invited to dinner at the home  
      of one of his friends. He did not know what to de with the wine, meat and  
      chicken he had just bought. Certainly he could not leave them to the  
      servant. Then he had an idea. He called up the servant and said to him:</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll be away for the whole evening, and I'll  
      leave you to look after the house. In the cupboard there are two bottles  
      filled with poison. Be careful about it. You'll be killed if you take even  
      a drop of it. There is also some meat and chicken in the cupboard. Take  
      care of them. &quot; With these words the rich old man left home.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the master turned his back, the servant  
      opened the cupboard and began to enjoy all the nice things in it. He  
      emptied the two bottles and ate up the meat, the chicken and everything  
      else he found in the cupboard. He was satisfied and soon fell asleep.At  
      mid-night<br> 
      the rich old man returned home. He looked into the cupboard and, to his  
      great surprise, all his wine and food were gone. He was mad with anger and  
      called the servant up.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh, Master,&quot; the servant began before the  
      old man could open his mouth. &quot;While you were away, the neighbour's  
      black cat stole into our kitchen and ate up everything in the cupboard. I  
      knew you would be very angry with me. I was so afraid that I drank the two  
      bottles of poison to kill myself. &quot; There were even tears in the  
      servant's eyes. &quot;Oh, Master,&quot; he continued. &quot;Please don't  
      get angry with a dying man. I'll soon be dead. &quot;<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich old man, of course, did not believe a word of  
      his story. But again, he muld do nothing about it.<br>
