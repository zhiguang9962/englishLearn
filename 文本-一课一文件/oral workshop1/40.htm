      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary wanted to be a nurse when she left school , but  
      in the meantime, she joined the Red Cross and had some limited training<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was taught that, in case of an accident-and they  
      were plentiful in her town-she should give first aid at once and then  
      send' for a doctor.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, there was an accident in a busy street, and  
      when Mazy arrived soon after, she saw a man bending over a woman who had  
      been accidentally knocked down by a car and was lying motionless in the  
      street.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary ran up, pushed the man away, informed the crowd  
      that she was a Red Cross nurse and began to help the wounded woinan.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes, the man who had been bending over<br> 
      the woman when Mary arrived touched her on the shoulder and said,  
      &quot;When you reach the part about sending for a doctor,don't worry. I'm  
      here already. &quot;<br>

      Questions on Text B</strong></font></p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">7. Read the following passage once. Underline the key words while  
      reading and retell the passage to your partner.<br> 
      <br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We say that a person has good manners if he or she  
      behaves politely and<br> 
      is kind and helpful to others. Everyone likes a person with good manners  
      but no one likes a person with bad manners. &quot;Yes,&quot; you may say,  
      &quot;but what are good manners? How does one know what to do and what not  
      to do?&quot;</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, here are some examples of the things that a  
      well-mannered person does or does not do.<br> 
      He never laughs at people when they are in trouble. Instead, he tries to  
      help them. He is always kind, never cruel, to people. When people are  
      waiting for a bus, or in a post office, he takes his turn. He does not  
      push to the front line of the queue. In the bus he gives his seat to an  
      older person or a lady who is standing. If he accidentally bumps into  
      someone, or gets in their way, he says &quot;Excuse me&quot; or &quot;I'm  
      sorry&quot;.</font> 
      </p> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says &quot;Please&quot; when lte makes a request ,  
      and &quot;Thank you&quot; when he receives something. He stands up when he  
      is speaking to a lady or an older person, he does not sit down until the  
      other person is seated. He does not in'terrupt other people when they are  
      talking. He does not talk too much himself. He does not talk loudly or  
      laugh loudly in public. When he is eating he does not speak with his mouth  
      full of food. He uses a handkerchief when he sneezes or coughs.<br>
