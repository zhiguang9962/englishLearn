      Au Pair Girl<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gretel comes from Austria. She is eighteen years old. 
      She is going to stay with the Clark family for a year. Gretel has come to 
      England because she wants to improve her English. She works as an au pair 
      girl. She helps Mrs Clark in the house and attends English classes 
      regularly in her spare time.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gretel hasn' t been in England long and everything is 
      strange to her. She often compares life in London with life in Vienna. 
      Some things are nicer in London; other things are not so nice. For 
      instance, the shops are bigger in London than in Vienna and there is 
      greater variety. But it's more expensive to enjoy yourself in London. It's 
      expensive to have a meal at a restaurant or to go to a theatre.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gretel has got used to many things already, but she 
      can't get used to breakfast in England. &quot;You English eat so much in 
      the morning,&quot; she often says. &quot;Fruit juice, porridge, bacon and 
      egg, tea, toast and marmalade! How can you face all that food so early in 
      the day?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria had decided that as soon as she had finished 
      school she would become an au pair girl in London. Two of her friends had 
      already spent a year with a family in Kensington, and told her they had 
      had an interesting time and had managed to learn a lot of English. She was 
      advised by her Head Teacher to get her parents' consent and to make all 
      the necessary arrangements prior to her departure: have enough money for 
      her return fare, know exactly what kind of a family she was going to live 
      with and what they expected of her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after her eighteenth birthday Maria received a 
      letter from Mrs Hutchinson, the wife of an advertising executive, stating 
      the terms on which she would be employed. The Hutchinsons lived in a house 
      in Chelsea. They had three children; two boys, aged fourteen and ten, both 
      at boarding schools, the elder at a Public School in the Midlands and the 
      younger at a Preparatory School in Surrey;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">the youngest 
      child was a girl aged eight, and she went to the French Lycee in South 
      Kensington. During term time Maria would have to take the girl to school 
      in the morning and fetch her in the afternoon. She would have to help Mrs 
      Hutchinson in the house - washing up, making the beds, laying the table, 
      dusting the rooms, answering the door, taking telephone messages, shopping 
      and running errands.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">She would be 
      guaranteed three evenings a week free and could attend English classes 
      either from eleven till one in the morning or from half past one till four 
      in the afternoon. She would receive 3 a week pocket money. Maria was 
      delighted with the conditions and thought that they were fair. She also 
      liked the look of the family, as Mrs Hutchinson had thoughtfully enclosed 
      a photograph with her letter.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was nothing for a girl t.o be sent away to service 
      when she was eleven years old. That meant leaving the family as she had 
      never been parted from for a day in her life before, and going to some 
      place miles away to be treated like a dog. I've got nothing against girls 
      going into good service.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;In my 
      opinion, good service in a properly run big house was a wonderful training 
      for a lot of girls who never would have seen anything different all the 
      days of their lives if they hadn't gone. It was better than working on the 
      land, then, and if it still existed now, I reckon I'd rather see any of my 
      daughters be a goodhousemaid or a well-trained parlour maid than a 
      dolled-up shop-assistant or a factory worker.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">But folks are too 
      proud to work for other folks, now. even if it's to their own advantage, 
      though as far as I can see you are still working for other folks , 
      whatever you're doing. Big houses didn't want little<br>
      girls of eleven, even as kitchen maids, so the first few ycars had to be 
      put in somewhere else, before you got even that amount of promotion.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Big houses 
      expected good service, but you got good treatment in return. It . wasn't 
      like that at the sort of place my friends had to go. Mostly they went to 
      the farmers' houses within ten or twenty miles from where they'd been 
      born. These farmers were a jumped Up, proud lot who didn't know how to 
      treat the people who worked for them. They took advantage of the poor 
      people's need to get their girls off their hands to get little slaves for 
      nearly nothing. The conditions were terrible.<br>
