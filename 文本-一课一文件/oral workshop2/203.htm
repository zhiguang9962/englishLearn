      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Smith gave his wife ten pounds for her birthday-ten 
      pretty pound notes. So the day after her birthday, Mrs Smith went 
      shopping. She queued for a bus, got on and sat down next to an old lady. 
      After a while, she noticed that the old lady's handbag was open. Inside 
      it, she saw a wad of pound notes exactly like the one her husband had 
      given her. So she quickly looked into her own bag- the notes had 
      gone!&nbsp;</font>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080">Mrs Smith was 
      sure that the old lady who was sitting next to her had stolen them. She 
      thought she would have to call the police; but, as she disliked making a 
      fuss and getting people into trouble, she decided to take back the money 
      from the old lady's handbag and say nothing more about it. She looked 
      round the bus to make sure nobody was watching, then she carefully put her 
      hand into the old lady's bag , took the notes and put them in her own bag.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she got home that evening, she showed her husband 
      the beautiful hat she had bought.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &acute;How did you pay for it?' he asked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &acute;With the money you gave me for my birthday, of 
      course,' she replied.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &acute;Oh? What's that, then?' he asked, as he pointed 
      to a wad of ten pound notes on the table.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Goodbye, darling,' said Mr Mackin. 'I'll be late 
      tonight.' Poor George, she thought. He was always in a hurry in the 
      morning, and it wasn't unusual for him to come home late at night. He 
      worked for a shoe company in Lceds. and therc was such a lot of work that 
      he normally staycd in the office till seven or cight.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When George had left the house Mrs Mackin sat down. in 
      an armchair and turned on the radio. It was a few minutes past eight , and 
      she heard the last words of the news :'...wman who escaped from I.ceds 
      prison yesterday is still free. The police warn you not to open your door 
      to strangers. '</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned off the radio. The housework was waiting for 
      her. Shc made the beds and washed the dishes. There wasn't auy shopping to 
      do. and so she thought for a moment of all the Work in the garden.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mackins lived in a house with a large garden in a 
      suburb of Leeds. Behind the garden there were some trees. and then the 
      cpen fields.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly Mrs Mackin remembered the news. She laughed 
      uneasily. That prison is only 15 miles away, she thought. She didn't work 
      in the garden, she mended her husband 's shirts instead And she care.fully 
      lockcd the front door and closed all the windows.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was getting dark. She turned on the lights in the 
      livingroom.Thcn she noticed that she had turned on the lights in most of 
      the roonss in the house.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How silly I am!' she said nervously and went into the 
      other rooms and turned the leghts on.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person at the door said something loudly. but she 
      was so frightened that she dien't understand a word.<br>
      <br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you believe in ghosts? I don't, eitlter-or at least 
      I didn't until I heard a strange story the other day from Mr Mike Paton, 
      of 19 Marlborough llill.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all began on November 28, whcn Mr Paton's eight-ycar-old 
      son, Bob , was playing in the big back garden of his parents' house. He 
      met an old man with a long white beard. The old man told Bob he was 
      builcling the underground railway there, but Bob didn't believe him. Bob 
      told me afterwards that he knew the underground ran under Marlborough Hill 
      itself. The old man said there had been an accident the day before.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Then he went away.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first the Patons didn't believe Bob's story. Mrs 
      Paton told me that Bob often made up stories about ghosts and monsters, 
      like other children of his age. But Mr Paton was curious and decided that 
      he would go to the library to check up on the facts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He found that the railway compapy had started to build 
      the line to the west of Marlborough Hill in 1881. but they had run into an 
      underground river. Ten workmen had died in an accident and the Company had 
      changed the direction of the line and built the present tunnel under 
      Marlborough Hill. At first I didn't believe Mr Paton's storv either, so I 
      did some research myself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspector Bright of the Metropolitan Police said it was 
      natural to find tramps in the district in winter, but no one had reported 
      one answering the description I had given him since last August.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Joseph Griffiths of London Transport checked the 
      files on the accident for me. He told me that the accident had apparently 
      taken place on or very near the junction of Marlborough Hill and Woodstock 
      Avenue on 27 November 1881. Mr Paton's house stands on the corner!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The source of this extraordinary story was not affected 
      by the news. 'I told Mummy it was true,' young Bob Paton told me 
      yesterday. When I left the house he was playing happily with his toy 
      cars-in the garden!<br>
