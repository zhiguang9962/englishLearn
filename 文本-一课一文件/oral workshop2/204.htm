      Text A<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A musician who played Pop Music in a CLub lived in 
      boardinghouse in the centre of london. He always used to get back to his 
      room very late at night and sometimes inthe carly hours of<br>
      the morning. He was so tired when he got back that he would si ton the 
      edge of his bed ,take off his shoes and throw them on the floor and say. 
      'Thank goodness. another day is over.' He would thcn get into hcd and fall 
      fast aslecp.</font>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thepoor lodger who had the room under the 
      musician's was wokcn up cach night, or carly?in the morning. by the two 
      thuds that the two shoes made as thcy landcd On his ceiling.Finally, he 
      could not stand it any more and went and complained to thc musician.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally the musician was very upset and promiscd 
      that, in future, aftcr taking off his shoes, he would put them down as 
      quictly as possible on the carpct.<br>
      The ncxt day, he got back from his club at about one o'clock in the 
      morning. went up to his room, sat on the edge of his bed, took off one 
      shoe and threw it on the floor.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">He was just about 
      to do the same with the other when suddenly remcmbered the promise he had 
      made the day before. So with grcat care he put the second shoe down 
      silently on the carpet. Then he got into bed and fell fast aslecp. An hour 
      later, he was woken up by a violent knocking on his door. It was thc 
      lodger who slept in the room just under his.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Plcase, plcase, please,' the Iodger plcaded, 'drop the 
      other shoe. I have been waiting for a whole hour for you to drop it. As 
      soon as you do I can go to sleep. '</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the men who ever liked fresh air, not one liked 
      it more than James Wilson. He took long walks in the fresh air. He ran 
      long distances in the fresh air. He played football and other games in the 
      fresh air. He liked to climb mountains and breathe the fresh air at the 
      top. He used to go to sit by the sea and watch the great waves in the 
      fresh air. He always slept with his windows wide open. He had an open car 
      with no roof, and he drove it madly through the fresh air.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Wilson entered a room where the windows were shut, 
      he immediately opened them. He did this even when snow was falling 
      outside. If someone else shut the windows again, he walked out of the room 
      in a manner which showed his opinions without any doubt. When he travelled 
      by sea, he could usually be found in a place on board where the wild wind 
      was blowing through his hair.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One winter Wilson went to Finland on business. Good 
      hotels in Finland are heated during the cold winter, and this winter was 
      even colder than usual. When Wilson reached his room in the hotel. he 
      found that the windows were closed to keep the icy air out. He did his 
      best to open one , but failed. It was absolutely impossible to open it : 
      the manager had very wisely arranged that.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilson undressed and got into bed. He was a very angry 
      man.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedroom was very pleasant. Two or three pictures on 
      the walls showed views of some beautiful parts of Finland. There was no 
      noise at all. The bed was really excellent; but Wilson could not sleep. He 
      could not forget the closed window. No fresh air! It was terrible to think 
      of!</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got out of bed and tried once more to open the 
      window; but it was useless, and he sadly got back into bed.<br>
      At about one o'clock in the morning he was still awake, worrying about the 
      air in the bedroom. He had turned over in bed two hundred and thirty-six 
      times. He was very hot. As he turned over for the two hundred and 
      thirty-seventh time, one arm came out of the bedclothes and hung down 
      beside the bed. His hand touched the floor. It also touched something on 
      the floor. This thing was a shoe.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An idea came into his worried mind. Angry men act 
      quickly,<br>
      and the shoe was in his hand in less than a second. Where was the window? 
      He could see something that looked like glass over there. He threw the 
      shoe through the darkness with all the force of his strong right arm.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shoe flew straight through the air and hit the 
      glass in the middle. A terrible sound of breaking glass filled the 
      bedroom,<br>
      but to Wilson's sad heart it seemed like the sound of sweet and beautiful 
      music.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now I have some fresh air in the room,&quot; he 
      thought. &quot;NOW I need not die. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later he was peacefully asleep. He did not 
      move for many hours.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When daylight came gently through the window, he awoke 
      and lay with his eyes closed. Where was he? Oh, yes! He was in Fioland; 
      but what the matter? Was auytlting wrong'? There was something to worry 
      about What was it? Oh. the broken windmv! Yes, indeed. He would have to 
      pas?for that.How much.? Was it a big piece of glass? He could not 
      remember. He Opened his eyes to look.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly he tnrned them towards the window. and then he 
      sat up suddenly in bed. He was very surprised: the window was not broken 
      at all. The glass was all in one piece. just as good as it had been the 
      might before. No fresh air was etitering the room through that window.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What,then,had happened when he threw the shoe?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned his eyes to the side and saw a broken picture 
      hanging on the wall.There was a shoe on the floor below it. He could see a 
      lot of broken glass round the shoe . and there was more inside it.<br>
      <br>
