      How It Feels When Parents Divorce<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      Ari, age fourteen<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my parents were married, I hardly ever saw my Dad<br>
      becausc he was always busy working. Now that they're divorced , I've 
      gotten to know him more because I'm with him everu weckend. And I really 
      look forward to the weekends because it's kind of like a break-it's like 
      going to Disncyland because thcre's no set schedule, no &quot;Be home by 
      five-thirty&quot; kind of stuff. It's open. It's free. And my father is 
      always buying me presents.</font>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mom got remarried and divorced again, so I've gone 
      through two divorces so far. And my father's also gotten remarricd-to 
      someone I don't get along with all that well. It's all rnade me fcel that 
      people shouldn't get married-they should just livc together and make their 
      own agreement. Then, if things get bad , they don't have to get divorced 
      and hire lawyers and sue each other. And. even more important, they don't 
      have to end up hating each other.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd say that the worst part of the divorce is the money 
      problem. It's been hard on mv Mom because lots of times she can't pay her 
      bills, and it makes her angry when I stay with my fatherand he buys me 
      things. She gets mad and says things like &quot;If he can buy you things 
      like this , then he should be able to pay me. &quot; And I feel caught in 
      the middle for two reasons;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">first, I can't 
      really enjoy whatever my Dad does get for me, and second, I don't know who 
      to believe. My Dad's saying, &quot;I don't really owe her any money,&quot; 
      and my Mom's saying he does. Sometimes I fight for my Mom and sometimes I 
      fight for my Dad, but I wish they'd leave me out of it completely.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a lot of ways I wish my Mom would get remarried, 
      because then she wouldn't have to worry so much about finances. But I'm 
      sorry that my Dad got remarried, because I feel left out a lot of times. 
      And one thing I really worry about is that I think they want to have a 
      baby, and I know that if they do, it will be just like a replacement for 
      me.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">That's because I 
      only see my Dad on weekends, and since he would see the baby more than 
      he'd see me, he'd probably grow to like it more than he likes me. It could 
      be a lot like what happened with my dog Spunkur.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I've had him for 
      about six years and I've always said I'll never love any dog as much as I 
      love him. Well, a year ago I picked up a little black Labrador puppy from 
      the pound, and now I find I'm not as friendly with Spunkur as I used to 
      be. And I think Spunkur feels jealous , just like I would if my Dad and my 
      stepmother had a baby.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">&nbsp;My Dad said 
      it wouldn't be that way, that we'd be a whole family and I'd have a little 
      brother or sister, which would be a lot of fun, but I told him, 
      &quot;Look, by the time the kid is old ehougli to talk, I'll be out of 
      college. I'm not going to have anything to do with a baby. You know that 
      it's just a replacement for me ! &quot;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I lived'full-time with my Dad, it would probably be 
      easier for me to accept a haby because we'd be on an equal footing, but 
      I'd rather stay with my Mom, where life is normal-where we<br>
      live like most people live, with breakfast at breakfast time and dinner at 
      d;nner time. I do my homework, play with my friends-it's all the way life 
      should be. If I lived with my Dad, it might be more fun at times, but I 
      would go crazy. I wouldn't want to be brought up that way.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Sara, age twelve<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the main reason I was mad at Daddy was because 
      it all made my mother so unhapp.y, and I ended up feeling sorry for both 
      of them-my mother because she was struggling to make ends meet, and my Dad 
      because he couldn't really do much about it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though my parents separated more than three years 
      ago, it's still very vivid in my mind and I doubt if I'll ever forget the 
      way I felt at the time. Yet, as awful as it was, I never hoped they'd get 
      back together. And now I think I'd die if they did, because it would be so 
      awkward for rne.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I think they're 
      both much happier now,. and it's obvious to me that they both lead totally 
      different lives. Since the breakup I've been able to see my parents' true 
      colors' especially my mother's. I've seen a side of her that I never saw 
      before. When she was married, she and Daddy were the perfect couple, 
      always quiet, talking about dignified things, and they would never laugh 
      or anything.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Nowadays my 
      mother is always happy and ggy. Another way she's changed is that she 
      always used to hide her problems from me but now she's more apt to discuss 
      things. I think she's more relaxed-and so's my Dad.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of my parents started dating other people right 
      away, and I think they'll both get remarried eventually, which is fine 
      with me. They don't discuss their love lives with me all that much, but of 
      course I'm not blind. For example, one night I had a sleep-over at a 
      friend's house and the next morning I came home earlier than I'd planned 
      to.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">&nbsp;Well, I 
      just stormed into my mother's bedroom, and there was this guy in her 
      bed-she was somewhere else, in another room. I started crying and 
      everything, and my mother tried to convince me she had slept on the couch. 
      Now that I look back, it was pretty hilarious, and of course I don't 
      care-I mean, I understand about those kind of arrangements.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">In the beginning, 
      when my father had a girlfriend sleep over, he didn't know how to tell 
      me-he just sort of said, &quot;Oh , you're sleeping on the couch tonight , 
      &quot; because at that point I didn't have my own room at his house and 
      shared the bedroom.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">&nbsp;It's still 
      hard for my Dad to level with me about this part of his life, but he's 
      getting better. Anyhow, neither of them should worry about my getting 
      upset, because I'm old enough to understand that grown-ups are allowed to 
      have private lives, which includes other people. But if someone's going to 
      spend the night, I think it's better and less awkward if I know about it 
      beforehand, so I'm not taken by surprise.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still want to get married and have kids , but I have 
      a lot of friends who don't want to. I was discussing marriage with one boy 
      I know, and he said, &quot;I'm never ever getting married. &quot; He took 
      his parents' divorce really badly because his mother and father weren't 
      friends afterwards-they were enemies, screaming on the phone to each 
      other. I'm glad my parents are good friends, having lunch together and 
      stufi. I think it's so much easier for the child if the parents are 
      friendly. If they aren't, it's really difficuit because there's always a 
      right side and a wrong side and the kids are just caught in the middle.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I've grown up a little faster because of rny 
      parents' divorce. It's made me realize more about the problems of life and 
      helped me to understand my parents-and appreciate them as individuals. 
      It's just too bad they couldn't have been as happy and productive as a 
      couple as they've been since they've been on their own. And I also wish 
      that the next time my mother has tickets for a Rolling Stonesl8 concert, 
      she takes me instead of her boyfriend, which is what she did the last 
      time!<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Heather, age eleven<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have to switch back and forth, doing it on a 
      weekly basis seems to work the best. I'll try to make one room my real 
      room and have the otherone Iike camping out. I can't buy two of 
      everytlring, so I might as well have one good room that's really mine.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another aspect of josnt custody that's difficult is 
      that my parents have very different rules and philosophies about life. For 
      example, my Dad's attitude is that he lets us learn by our mistakes , and 
      my mother does exactly the opposite-she tells us how to act before we make 
      the mistake. And my Dad says we can watch TV for a while after school , 
      and my Mom says we can'tthat we have to sel'ect our programs verv 
      carefully.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">At my Dad's house 
      Matthew has to do his homework right away, but he gets to stay up until 
      nine and watch The A I'eam because that's his favorite show. Mom doesn't 
      want him to when we're at her house but she feels she has to give in 
      because Matthew says, &quot;Well, Daddy lets me do that at his house. 
      &quot; He's learning to play them against each other at a very early age. 
      I don't do that, but I have to admit there are times when I secretly wish 
      I was at whichever house I'm not at.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be nice if there could be a special house for 
      divorced families. It would be like two houses, side by side, with a place 
      in the middle where the kids could live. Then when parents had arguments 
      they could each go to their own place and get away from each other and 
      think things out by themselves.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">That way, they 
      could realize how dumb they were behaving and get back together again. I 
      know it's too late for that kind of arrangement with my parents-and as I 
      look back I see that they're both.happier being apart. My father's become 
      a different person, you know, and it's unbelievable.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">I like the person 
      he is now because he doesn't get angry as fast as he used to. And my 
      mother's much happier because she doesn't have to worry about getting 
      Daddy mad. Another good thing that's happened is that my father's turned 
      into a terrific cook, and it makes me feel proud to be one of the only</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      , people in my class whose father cooks and does things like' taking me to 
      hockey practice and to sewing. And it's great to see how my Mom doesn't 
      have to rely on Daddy to pay the bills and throw out the garbage. She's 
      working now and that's helped her feel important. Neither of them has to 
      rely on the other one in dumb ways, the way they used to, and I 
      thinkthey're both much better off as a result. I know that neither of them 
      will ever be able to forget all the anger, but I think that as time gdes 
      on they'll sort of come to their senses and be pretty good friends. That's 
      what I hope for more than anything in the world!<br>
