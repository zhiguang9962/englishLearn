      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gretel and Mrs Clark went shopping in the centre of 
      London yesterday.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'd like to know which store you like best in 
      London, Mrs Clark , &quot; Gretel said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now that's a difficult question,&quot; Mrs Clark 
      replied. &quot;I just haven't any idea which store I like best. There are 
      so many huge stores in London. I suppose Selfridges must be the 
      biggest.&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">There's so much 
      variety there. I can usually find what I'm looking for. Then there's 
      Liberty's. It's such a lovely building. Harrods is very famous, too. It's 
      such a smart store, I love all the big stores in London because you can 
      walk round and nobody bothers you. Nobody tries to sell you 
      anything-unless you want to buy something.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Sometimes I 
      go window-shopping , or just wander round a store and look at the things 
      on display. The big stores are one of the sights of London. I went to the 
      sales in January. That was one of the sights of London, too! My goodness!<br>
      The crowds! But it was worth it. I bought some lovely things very cheaply. 
      It was good fun, but very exhausting.<br>
      </font></p>

      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she walked round the huge department store, Edith 
      reflectde how difficult it was to choose a suitable Christmas present for 
      her father. She wished that he was as easy to please as her mother, who 
      was always delighted with perfume.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, shopping at th'ss time of the year was a most 
      disagreeable experience : people trod on your toes , poked you with their 
      elbows and almost knocked you over in their haste to get to a bargain 
      ahead of you.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partly to have a rest, Edith paused in front of a 
      counter where some attractive ties were on display. 'They are real silk' 
      the assistant assured her, trying to tempt her. 'Worth double the price. ' 
      But Edith knew from past experience that her choice of ties. hardly ever 
      pleased her father.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She moved on reluctantly and then, quite by chance, 
      stopped where a small crowd of men had gathered round a counter. She found 
      some good quality pipes on sale - and the prices were very reasonable. 
      Edith did not hesitate for long: although her father only smoked a pipe 
      occasionally, she knew that this was a present which was bound to please 
      him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she got home, with her small but well-chosen 
      present concealed in her handbag, her parents were already at table having 
      supper. Her mother was in especially cheerful mood. `Your father has at 
      last decided to stop smoking,' she informed her daughter.<br>

      Shops<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most shops in Britain open at 9. 00 a. m. and close at 
      5. 00 or 5. 30 in the evening. Small shops usually close for an hour at 
      lunchtime. On one or two days a week-usually Thursday and/or Friday-some 
      large food shops stay open until about 8. 00 p. m. for late night 
      shopping.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many shops are closed in the afternoon on one day a 
      week. The day is usually Wednesday or Thursday and it is a different day 
      in different towns. Nearly all shops are closed on Sundays. Newspaper 
      shops are open in the morning, and sell sweets and cigarettes as well. But 
      there are legal restrictions on selling many things on Sundays.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, overseas visitors don't have much 
      difficulty knowing where to buy things. Most shops sell the things that 
      you would expect them to. One problem is stamps. In Britain you can only 
      buy these at post-offices.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      Many large food shops (supermarkets ) are self-service. When you go into 
      one of these shops you take a basket and you put the things you wish to 
      buy into this. You queue up at the cash-desk and pay for everything just 
      before you leave.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone tries to take things from a shop without 
      paying they are almest certain to be caught. Most shops have store 
      detectives who have the job of catching shoplifters. Shoplifting is 
      considered a serious crime by the police and the courts.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are waiting to be served in a shop it is 
      important to wait your turn. It is important not to try to be served 
      before people who arrived before you. Many people from overseas are 
      astonished at the British habit of queueing.<br>
