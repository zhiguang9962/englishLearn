      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today my cousin paid us a visit. She is a technician 
      working in an electronics factory. She has been very unhappy recently 
      because of a quarrel with her boss. It all started when she was denied a 
      chance to go abroad for a training course.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">By qualification 
      she was the ideal choice - a college degree, a working knowledge of 
      English and generally acknowledged as very good in her field. But the 
      final choice fell on a young man inferior to her in every respect. 
      Naturally she was very upset and wanted to know why. Her boss who in fact 
      quite liked her told her quite candidly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&quot;We 
      did think of sending you but decided against it because you are a girl. 
      &quot; The answer infuriated her all the more and she accused him of sex 
      discrimination. The best explanation she could get out of him was that it 
      would not be &quot;convenient&quot; for a girl to be on her own in a 
      foreign country as there was only one vacancv.Not convenicnt for whom? For 
      herself? She didn't mind. For her fellow trainees? That's sheer nonsense. 
      For her boss? How and in what way?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor girl , I quite sympathize with her , but that 
      women are at a disadvantage is a reality she'll have to face. I told her 
      that our form master was telling us only the other day that girls 
      shouldn't aim too high in choosing their future speciality or choosing a 
      university: Certain subjects and certain departments are almost closed to 
      them. They'll have to have 10 or more marks than the boys in order to be 
      accepted.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And it's not only the colleges and 
      universities,&quot; Mum explained with anger. &quot;All organizations and 
      work units are equally bad in sex discrimination when taking in new 
      mployees.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      One's sex is more important than one's other qualities , it seems. Some 
      departments take in women just as if they are forced to buy some inferior 
      goods. The bargaining that goes on just makes me sick. You want to buy a 
      carton of high-grade cigarettes? Very well , you must buy three packs of 
      the cheap brand as well. So if you want to assign one girl to our 
      department, you must give us two boys as well. It's really disgusting ! 
      &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't blame them really, &quot; said Dad. 
      &quot;However good a girl is , when she marries,trouble begins. First 
      there is this long maternity leave. Then there'll be constant leaves 
      because there will always be this or that wrong .with her darling baby. 
      Even when she works she will be constantly thinking of her darling child 
      or knitting for him or her. And she becomes petty too,breaking into tears 
      at the slightest provocation and quarrelling with others over trifles.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This naturally brought a barrage of protests and 
      condemnations from the two women in the room who almost tore him to 
      pieces. In the end it was Granny who came to his rescue.&quot;Well, a 
      woman's place is at home, as I always say. And what do you want to go 
      abroad for, child? Think of all the dangers! How can girls cope with them? 
      I think your leaders were quite right in not letting you go. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh Granny, you don't know anything at all! You 
      are still living in the old world. It seems our future lies in the future 
      generation,&quot; my cousin said pointedly to Dad, referring to me. 
      Actually she is only ten years older than me.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equality of the sexes is certainly a very 
      complicated problem. Just having equal rights to vote and equal pay for 
      equal work have not solved the problem, not by a long shot.<br>

      I Want a Wife<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I belong to that classification of people known as 
      wives, I am A Wife. And, not altogether incidentally. I am a mother.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the 
      scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, 
      with his ex-wife. He is obviously looking for another wife. As I thought 
      about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that 
      I, too, Would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want a wife who assumes the complete responsibility 
      for birth control, because I do not waat more children. I want a wife who 
      will remain sexually fait.hful to me so that I do not have to clutter up 
      my intellectual life with jealousies. And I want a wife who understands 
      that my sexual needs may entail more than strict adherence to monogamy. I 
      must, after all, be able to relate to people as fully as possible.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If , by chance , I find anothe: person more suitable as 
      a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my 
      present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; 
      my wife will take the children and be solely responsible for them so that 
      I am left free.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am through with school and have a job, I want my 
      wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and 
      completely take care of a wife's duties.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My God, who wouldn't want a wife?<br>
