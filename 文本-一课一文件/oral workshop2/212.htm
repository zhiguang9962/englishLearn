      Seeing the World<br>

      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone offered to pay all my expenses for a month's 
      holiday anywhere in the world, I would feel very surprised and very 
      excited. It would be difficult to decide where I wanted to go. Should I go 
      to one place or to lots of different places? If I went to one country, I 
      could see and understand a lot about it. If I went to lots of countries, 
      my holiday would be more interesting and more exciting. I think I would 
      decide to fly around the world and to visit three different countries. The 
      countries I would visit would be Australia, the United States of America 
      and Kenya.</font>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I went to Australia, I would stay there for about 
      two weeks. I am sure it would be very interesting to visit a country which 
      is so very different from my own. Before I went, I would write to one of 
      my Australian friends. I would suggest that if it were possible, he should 
      spend a week with me visiting Aboriginal tribes in the northern part of 
      Australia. I would really like to find out how the Aboriginal people live 
      in Australia today. My friend could explain what we saw and he could 
      translate what people said because he majored in Aboriginal Studies at 
      Queensland University. While I was visiting Australia, I hope I could also 
      see some of the large cities , such as Sydney and Melbourne.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I went to the United States , I would stay there 
      about a week. I expect I would start by visiting New YorkS. I have heard 
      that New York is a very exciting city. I imagine that there are, lots of 
      tourist attractions, that the buildings are spectacular and that the food 
      is very varied. After I had stayed two or three days in New York, I would 
      fly to San Francisco. I hope I could stay with my relations who live there 
      and I would visit the city and other parts of California.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would fly to Kenya where I would stay for 
      about a week. There are three things I would like to do in Kenya. First , 
      I hope I could visit the coast because I would like to see the old Arab 
      cities and enjoy the beautiful beaches. Next, I would like to visit a Game 
      eserve. I imagine the wild animals of Africa- the lion, elephant and 
      hippopotamus- are very exciting and beautiful. Finally, I would like to 
      visit the Mountains of Kenya where you can see snow on the Equator.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone offered me this money, I would be amazed. 
      Unfortunately, I do not think this will ever happen and I doubt if I shall 
      ever visit these countries.</font></p>

      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann started work last summer, so she didn't have a 
      holiday.She saved as much as she could and, in January, she booked a 
      package trip to Rosas, in Spain. She left London airport early on the 
      norning of the-first Saturday in August. She was very excited, as this was 
      her first trip abroad. During the flight they had a snack , and when they 
      arrived at Barcelona airport,a special bus was ready to take them to their 
      hotel in Rosas. The weather was beautiful and Ann enjoyed the bus trip.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hotel, she checked in, and then went to her room 
      to change before dinner. She was just ready to go downstairs, when she 
      found that her Spanish money wasn't in her handbag. She carefully looked 
      in all her luggage, but she couldn't find it. All she had was a small 
      purse with ten English pound notes in it!</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ann found a place to change her English money. She had 
      very few pesetas, and she would be here for two weeks. On her way back to 
      the hotel, Ann bought some cheese, some bread and some oranges. When she 
      got back, she told the manager that her doctor had told her not to eat 
      Spanish food; she'd just have breakfast each day. This was all right , as 
      she knew the price of hotels included breakfast.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the rest of her holiday, Ann swam in the hotel 
      swimming-pool, or lay on the beach and got a suntan. She also went for 
      long walks with one of the other tourists, a Scottish girl called Jane. 
      However, when the others went to interesting places, she always said she 
      wasn't well. In fact, her holiday wasn't bad, except that she was always 
      hungry. After all, a piece of fruit for lunch, and bread and cheese for 
      supper isn't very much. . . especially not for two weeks !</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late in the afternoon of their last day, Ann and Jane 
      were on the beach. Jane asked her why she never ate with them in the hotel 
      restaurant. The food was excellent. Ann told her all about her money 
      problems. Jane looked at her for a minute, and then said, &quot;But didn't 
      you know? The price of this holiday includes absolutely everything!&quot;<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      TRAVEL BOOKS<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several ways you can find out aboiit the 
      countries and places you wish to visit. You can talk to friends who have 
      travelled to the places. Or you can go and see a colour film about them. 
      Or you can read travel books.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would seem that there are three kinds of travel 
      books. The first are those that give a personal, subjective account of 
      travels which the author has actually made himself. If they are 
      informative and have a good index then they can be useful to you when you 
      are planning your traves. The second kind are those books whose purpose is 
      to give a purely objective description of things to be done and seen.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">&nbsp;If a 
      well-read, cultured person has written such a book then it is even more 
      useful. It can be classified as a selective guide book. The third kind are 
      those books which are called 'a guide' to some place or other. If they are 
      good, they will, in addition to their factual information, give an 
      analysis or an interpretation. Like the first kind they can be inspiring 
      and entertaining. But their primary function is to assist the<br>
      reader who wishes to plan in the most practical way.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever kind of travel book you choose you must make 
      sure that it does not describe everything as 'marvellous' , 'fabulous' or 
      'magical' . You must also note its date of publication because travel is a 
      very practical affair and many things change quickly in the twen tieth 
      century. Finally, you should make sure that the contents are well 
      presented and easy to find.</font></p>
