      Remembering My Grandparents<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When memory began for me, my grandfather was past 
      sixty-a great tall man with thick hair becoming gray. He had black eyes 
      and a straight nose which ended in a slightly flattened tip. Once he 
      explained seriously to me that he got that flattened tip as a small child 
      when he fell down and stepped on his nose.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little marks of laughter at the corners of his eyes 
      were the prodnct of a kindly and humorous nature. The years of work which 
      had bent his shoulders had never dulled his humour nor his love of a joke.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere he went, &quot;Gramp&quot; made friends 
      easily. At the end of half an hour you felt you had known him all your 
      life. I soon learned that he hated to give orders , but that when he had 
      to, he tried to make his orders sound like suggestions.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One July morning, as he was leaving to go to the 
      cornfield, he said : &quot;Edwin, you can pick up the potatoes in the 
      field today if you want to do that. &quot; Then he drove away with his 
      horses.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day passed, and I did not have any desire to pick 
      up potatoes. Evening came and the potatoes were still in the field. Gramp, 
      dusty and tired, led the horses to get their drink.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How many bags of potatoes were there?&quot; Gramp 
      inquired. &quot;I don't know. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How many potatoes did you pick up?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I didn't pick any. &quot; &quot;Not any! Why 
      not?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You said I could pick, them up if I wanted to. 
      You didn't say I had to. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next few minutes I learned a lesson I would not 
      forget: when Gramp said I could if I wanted to, he meant that I should 
      want to.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gram hated cruelty and injustice. The injustices of 
      history, even those of a thousand years before, angered her as much as the 
      injustices of her own day.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also had a deep love of beauty. When she was almost 
      seventy-five, and had gone to live with one of her daughters, she spent a 
      delightful morning washing dishes because, as she said, the beautiful 
      patterns on the dishes gave her pleasure. The bird, the flowers, the 
      clouds-all that was beautiful around her- pleased her. She was like the 
      father of the French painter, Millet, who used to gather grass and show it 
      to his son , saying , &quot;See how beautif ul this is ! &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a pioneer society it is the harder qualities of mind 
      and character that are of value. The softer virtues are considered 
      unnecessary. Men and women struggling daily to earn a living are unable, 
      even for a moment, to forget the business of preserving their lives. Only 
      unusual people, like my grandparents, manage to keep the softer qualities 
      in a world of daily struggle.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such were the two people with whom I spent the months 
      from June to September in the wonderful days of summer and youth.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He always rose early to enjoy at least two hours of 
      solitude in the house and garden before the rest of the family came down 
      In winter he spent most of the time reading and writing. In sum mer he 
      liked to get out of doors to work in the kitchen garden or to take the dog 
      for a walk in the neighbouring woods and fields Whatever the weather, 
      there was plenty to occupy him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Although he 
      was a creature of habit, there seemed to be an infinite variety in his 
      pursuits. He wrote book reviews regularly for two of the national 
      weeklies. He worked conscientiously his special subject, Indian History, 
      and was thus one of the world authorities on it;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;he 
      collected modern abstract paintings and so had a circle of friends amongst 
      artists and sculptors; there was hardly anything he did not know about 
      traditional jazz and he often entertained both British and America n jazz 
      musicians He was a superb cook and knew a lot about French and German 
      food.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;His family 
      adored him and in a sense he was spoiled by them. At first glance you 
      would have taken him for a retired army officer-his bearing was erect, his 
      hair was cut short, he was fussy about his clothes, which were always 
      neat, clean and conventional. He liked to keep fit, and this was reflected 
      in his clear, steady blue eyes and healthy suntanned complexion. He hardly 
      ever watched TV, but enjoyed a good film and an occasional evening at the 
      theatre.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elderly who find great rewards and satisfactions in 
      their later lives are a small minorit.y in this country. But they do 
      exist. They are the&quot;aged elite&quot;.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is most striking about these people is their 
      capacity for growth. When Arthur Rubinstein was eighty, someone told him 
      that he was playing the piano better than ever. &quot;I think so,&quot; he 
      agreed. &quot;Now I take chances I never took before. I used to be so much 
      more careful. No wrong notes. Not too bold ideas. Now I let go and enjoy 
      myself and to hell with everything except the music!'</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason for the success of the aged elite are 
      the traits they' have formed earlier in their lives. A 
      sixty-eight-year-old woman, three times married and widowed , says , 
      &quot;It's not just what you do when you're past sixty-five.<br>
      It's what you did all your life that matters. If you've lived a full life, 
      developed your mind, you'll be able to use it past sixty-five. Let the 
      young people put that in their soup and eat it. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with frankness comes humor. A sense of humor, of 
      course, is not something that suddenly arrives at age sixty-five. It is an 
      aid people use all their lives to cope with tension. &quot;Humor, &quot; 
      says Dr James Birren, noted psychologist, also leads you to join with 
      other people. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to associate with others is another trait 
      of the aged elite. &quot;There are two ways to deal with stress,&quot; 
      says Birren. &quot;You either reach out or withdraw. The reachers seek out 
      other people to share their problems instead of pulling away. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing, active, humorous, sharing-these are all 
      qualities that describe the aged elite.<br>
