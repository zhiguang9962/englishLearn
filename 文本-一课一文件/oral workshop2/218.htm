      How to Keep Fit<br>
      <br>

      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years ago I used to be very fit. T cycled to work 
      and I got a lot of exercise at the weekends. I used to play tennis a lot 
      and go for long walks. In those days I didn't earn very much. I had a job 
      in an office. It wasn't a very good job but I had a lot of time to do the 
      things I enjoyed doing.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, about eight years ago, I got a much better job. 
      The pay was better. But the hours were a lot longer, too. I bought a Far 
      and drove to work every day. I began to take people out to lunch. 'Expense 
      account' lunches. And I began to put on weight, too. I stopped playing 
      tennis and going for long walks at the weekend because I just didn't have 
      any time for things like that any more.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">There's a lot of 
      stress in a job like mine. Perhaps that's why I starred drinking more than 
      I used to. For example,I used to have only half a glass of whisky when I 
      got home, then I started filling the glass to the top. Then I had another 
      glass , and then another. I started smoking a lot , too. I never used to 
      smoke at all.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months ago I had a heart attack. At first I just 
      couldn't believe it. `I'm too young,' I said. Luckily it wasn't very 
      serious. I was in hospital.a few days and they did a lot of tests. The 
      doctor advised me to stop smoking and to eat less. He told me to do a lot 
      of other things , too. But I don't see how I can do some of them and keep 
      my job. For example, he advised, me to work less, and get more exercise. 
      But I just havern't any time! My job takes everything out of me!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder if I should get. anather jab. 
      Perhaps I could do something like I used to do. But if I do that, I won't 
      earn as much. I have a family to support: I have to think of them, too. I 
      just don't know what I should do. What do you think?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is one person who really believes in keeping fit. 
      Her name is Mrs Laura Taylor. She is 45 but looks at least 10 years 
      younger. Let's listen to her story.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started about two. years ago. Tn those days 
      things were very different. I was overweight. I used to smoke a lot- about 
      30'cigarettes a day. I never got any exercise. I used to stay at home all 
      day: I never went out into the fresh air, except to do the shopping.. And 
      even then I used to take the car.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">One day I looked 
      at myself in the misror.'My God,' I thought. `I look terrible t' I tried 
      to touch my toes. I couldn't.do it. I found an old dress.I couldn't put it 
      on. It was too small. Or rather, I was too fat! The next day I tried to 
      jog a little. At first it was terrible. I mean I just couIdn't run. Not 
      even a short distance. And at ftrst people used to laugh at me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Why are you running? Are you in a hurry?' they 
      shouted. But now I've completely changed the way i live. I've stopped 
      reating meat and I've statted,eating far more fresh vegetables. My husband 
      and daughter have started that, tdo. At first they didn't like the new 
      food. But they've changed. About six months ago I sold my car and bought a 
      bike. Recently I've started doing yoga exercises. My husband often goes 
      cycling with me now and my daughter jogs with me in the evening. 'They've 
      both lost weight and are much healthier than they used to be, too.<br>

      YOGA<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever tried to hold your breath for a long time 
      and then let it out slowly? This is one of the techniques of an ancient 
      Indian discipline known as Yoga. For thousands of years , people have used 
      Yoga to help search for happiness and contentment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students of Yoga often study for as long as 20 years 
      before becoming masters, or Yogis. They learn many different physioal 
      exercises. These exercises are designed to put the students in good 
      Physical condition. Then they can concentrate on deep religious thoughts 
      without worrying about physical discomforts.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Yoga exercises involve putting the body into 
      difficult positions. Some of them are very hard to learn. Have you ever 
      tried to fold your legs over one another? This is one of the basic Yoga 
      positions. It is called the lgtus position. Most people find it difficult 
      to stay in that positio for even a few minutes. But Yogis train themselves 
      to remain in the lotus position for hours or even days. They are taught to 
      overcome the physical discomforts of holding these positions. Other 
      exercises and rules teach concentation- Yogis feel this is the key to 
      finding inner peace. This kind of concentration is called meditation.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogis and many other people practice meditatjon. They 
      claim that it makes them feel relaxed and peaceful. Some people say that 
      it makes them feel better - just as good exercise does. But other people 
      claim that it is a way of achieving a strong religious feeling. These 
      peopie say that meditation helps them feel much closer to God.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word Yoga itself comes from an ancient Saqgkrit 
      word meanin &quot;union&quot;. What kind of union do you think the word 
      refers to? Why would people<br>
      want to have this kind of experience?</font></p>
