      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1967, The Observer, one of Britain's leading Sunday 
      newspapers papers , organized a competition for secondary school-children 
      ; they had to write about &quot;The School that I'd Like&quot;. This meant 
      , of course , that they also had to say what was wrong with the schools 
      they had.<br>
      <br>
      David , 15<br>
      But what is the main purpose of schools to educate young people so that 
      when they go out into thewvorld they will be prepared for ~t? But are 
      they? We learn our Mathematics, English, Physics, etc. , but what do you 
      learn about sex, marriage and things like this? These are just as 
      important but we don't learn very much about them.<br>
      <br>
      Carol , 17<br>
      Give us more variety! Give us the chance to visit factories more 
      frequently , to talk with miners , dustmen , doctors , lawyers , 
      jail-birds and drug addicts, too. Give us the chance to visit remand mand 
      homes and prisons. We want to know more about life and less about books.<br>
      <br>
      Robin, 16<br>
      What a bore school is nowadays, the same as it has been for hunireds of 
      years. What we get is the same old thing: teacher, outdated<br>
      textbooks , and a class fed up to the teeth with the teacher and the 
      school. What we need is one great change in the educational system of the 
      country. Children do not want to be taught at, but want to find things for 
      themselves. If a child is interested in the way a rabbit's heart works, 
      let him go and find out, by cutting one up.<br>
      <br>
      Irena , 15<br>
      Homework should not be given. Many of us would rather spend another hour 
      at school than two hours at home doing an hour's homework, where we are 
      constantly being distracted by television<br>
      and such things.<br>
      <br>
      Sidney, 15<br>
      The first step must surely be to raise teachers'salaries by at least fifty 
      per cent so as to attract first-class people to the profession. And the 
      only means of doing this is by offering salaries equal to their 
      responsibility in shaping the hopes of tomorrow and competitive with those 
      offered by industry.<br>
      <br>
      Christopher, 16<br>
      The discipline and life of the school would be based on freedom for the 
      pupil. So freedom and a minimum of control would be important and the 
      pupils, male and female, would be treated as adults and allowed to see if 
      they can live together in a community like intelligent people. Given this 
      responsibility and freedom, the pupils obviously would not always be 
      well-behaved and sensible, but they would, I believe, grow up to be mature 
      and intelligent adults who are socially and in all other ways, useful to 
      the community.<br>
      <br>
      Margaret , 14<br>
      . . . all this (i. e. freedom in schools) suggests that the school would 
      always be chaotic, which would give all the. pupils an insihgt into what 
      life, after school, is like: chaos.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am beginning ro feel the pressure of work. None of 
      the courses are as simple as they appear to be. There are a lot of 
      reference books to consult and you can consider yourself lucky if you 
      manage to get half of them from the Iibrary. Most copies seem to be 
      permanently lent out. The reading rooms are always crowded and you have to 
      get there early in order to find a place.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest headache is our dormitory. Though there are 
      desks for us to work at, nobody ever works there. For one thing, the room 
      is so crowded that there is little elbow room, and it is so dark that we 
      need the electric light even in day time. The worst is the human element - 
      there are always those who don't want to work and won't let others work 
      either. They either chat, sing, play the guitar or listen to tapes. How I 
      miss my little cubicle of a room at home!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it's only a reaction against my early 
      excitement, but anyway I am often overcome by low spirits. Sometimes I 
      even think I am wasting my time here and wish I had not come here at all. 
      But of course I know they are only passing moods caused by my 
      disillusionment. I find some of the teachers just hopeless and totally 
      irresponsible. All they are interested in is to earn some extra money by 
      moonlighting. In one way. they are to be sympathized with because they do 
      need the extra money what .with their low salaries and the rising prices. 
      But surely they shouldn't let us suffer as a result.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My biggest disappointment is in my fellow students. Of 
      course I am ceferring only to some, and perhaps they are only a minority. 
      They are a far cry from my old image of college students. They dress and 
      behave no better than the hooligans we often see in the streets. I really 
      don't know how they managed to get into the university, for they don't 
      seem to be interested in their studies at all.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;All they 
      care for is to have a good time , as though to enter university is an end 
      in itself. They hold dances every Saturday evening or play cards in the 
      dormitories deep into the night , drinking and smoking heavily. What's 
      more they always jump the queue in the dining halls and quarrel with 
      anyone who tries to stop them. Once they even came to blows. What a 
      disgrace!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But despite all this, college life is opening up for me 
      a new vista that brings as much excitement as enlightenment. Here we can 
      talk about anything under the sun. I had always thought myself well-read 
      and my classmates at school had looked up to me for my wide &quot;general 
      knowledge&quot;. But now I've come to realize how ignorant I really 
      am.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Just from casual 
      conversaation and informal discussions , I've learnt more about the wvorld 
      and society in the past two months than what I learned from all the 
      fo.rmal classes at school. Also I found many extra-curricula lectures by 
      guest speakers most stimulating. One in particular inspired me very much, 
      a lecture on symphonic</font> <font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">music 
      by a young conductor from the Central Conservatory. Before, music used to 
      be merely a collection of beautiful sounds to me. But now I am constantly 
      discovering new and hidden meaning behind all these sounds.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I am sure; college life is and will be a most 
      colourful and fruitful period in my whole life.<br>
