      A Friend in Need of Help<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You and Sol have been friends for over fifteen years. 
      You went to high school together and now work in the same company pany. 
      For the past several months , Sol has been very irritable and at times has 
      shown his emotions by openly criticizing the company and some of his 
      fellow workers. Most of the people in the office know that he sometimes 
      drinks too much when he feels depressed about some of his personal and 
      family problems.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But recently Sol made a very nasty personal comment 
      which hurt'one of the people in the office. No one said anything to him, 
      but it was obvious that many people were angry at what he said and now 
      have little sympathy for him .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are beginning to wonder whether you should say 
      something to Sol. You don't consider him your best friend, but he might 
      possibly lose his job because you didn't try to help him. On the other 
      hand, you don't know whether Sol would think that you were interfering in 
      his privatu iife by talking about his personal problems.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would you do in this situation?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additioaal Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, studies of friendship seem to implicate more 
      eomplex factors. For exampte, one function friendship seems to futfil is 
      that it supports the image we have of ourselves, and confirms the value of 
      the attitudes we hold. Certainly we appear to project ourselves onto our 
      friends; several studies have shown that we judge them to be more like us 
      than they (objectively) are.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">This suggests 
      that we ought to choose friends who are similar to us ( 'birds of a 
      feather' ) rather than those who would be complementary ( 'opposites 
      attract' ) , a prediction which is supported by empirical evidence , at 
      least so far as attitudes and beliefs are concerned. In one experiment, 
      some developing friendships were monitored amongst first-year students 
      living in the same hostel.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">It was found that 
      similarity of attitudes (towards politics, religion and ethics, pastimes 
      and aesthetics) was a good predictor of what friendships would be 
      established by the end of four months, though it had less to do with 
      initial alliances - not surprisingly, since attitudes may not be obvious 
      on first inspection.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been studies of pairings, both 
      voluntary (married couples) ples ) and forced (student roommates ) , to 
      see which remained together and which split up. Again, the evidence seems 
      to favour similarity rather than complementarity as an omen of a 
      successful relationship, though there is a complication: where marriage is 
      concerned, once the field has been narrowed down to potential mates who 
      come from similar backgrounds and share a broad range of attitudes and 
      values, a degree of complementarity seems to become desirable.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">When a couple are 
      not just similar but almost identical, something else seems to be needed. 
      Similarity can breed contempt; it has also been found that when we find 
      others obnoxious, we dislike them more if they are like us than when they 
      are dissimilar!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty of linking friendship with similarity of 
      personality probably reflects the complexity of our personalities: we have 
      many facets and therefore require a disparate group of friends to support 
      us. This of course can explain why we may have two close friends who have 
      little in common, and indeed dislike each other. By and large, though, it 
      looks as though we would do well to choose friends (and spouses) who 
      resemble us. If this were not so, computer dating agencies would have gone 
      out of business years ago.<br>
