      Why Are They So Unlucky?</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder why so many shop-assistants are so 
      foultempered? Inspite of so many &quot;campaigns&quot; to improve the 
      services in the past years, we see no appreciable change so far. If Dad 
      and Mum are to be believed, the services used to be quite good in the 
      fifties. But then, they always say everything used to be good in the 
      fifties. I find the older people grow, the more nostalgic they 
      become.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Now Granny never 
      lets a day go by without remi-niscing on the good old things in the good 
      old days . Once when she saw Xiao Hong and me eating some mooncakes with 
      relish, she said pityingly, &quot;You poor children, you don't know what 
      real mooncakes taste like. The worst in the old tasted much better than 
      the best that rnoney can buy nowadays!&quot; We burst out laughing, not 
      taking her words seriously.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to come back to the bad service in shops and 
      department stores. People often say that when you buy something, you are 
      spending money to buy rudeness and anger. Today I saw a loing exactly 
      that. I was at a department store and I happened to witness a typical 
      quarrel. I was next to a counter selling tea and I saw an elderly man come 
      up and ask a young woman was busy weighing and wrapping tea into 
      standard-sized &quot;packs &quot;Do you have very good green tea?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman glanced up to size him up. He was ordinarily 
      dressed and spoke with a provincial accent. obviously a man of no 
      consequence. She went on with her work and the man had to repeat his 
      question. After another pause the woman snorted out: &quot;Yes: Twenty-six 
      yuan a liang. &quot; Not believing his ears, the man tried to correct her. 
      &quot;You mean twenty-six yuaw a jin?&quot; Upon this the woman flared up 
      and shouted: &quot;I said twenty-six yuan a LIANG ! Can't you hear 
      straight? If you want a jin, then it's two hundred and sixty yuan. Is that 
      CLEAR?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man seemed to be stunried by her sudden outburst 
      but he kept his temper and asked again. &quot;Do you have some thing under 
      two yuan' a Liang?&quot; Obviously she was makinj things difficult for the 
      old man for she answered as rudely as be fore;&quot;What do you mean under 
      two yuan? Anything from on cent to one yuan ninety-nine cents is under two 
      yuan. &quot; I don't remember what exaetly the man said , but somehow he 
      manage to find out there was a kind costing one yuan ninety-six a liang 
      &quot;Can you show it to me?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you want to buy it or not?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, I want to look at the leaves and smell the 
      flavoc first. &quot; &quot;You can look , smell , eat , drink or do 
      whatever you like with it at home. Here I only sell tea. If you want to 
      buy it, buy it. If you can't afford it, don't come here to waste people's 
      time Obviously you don't know what is proper in Beijing ! &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Look here young lady, it's you who don't know 
      what proper! I have been living in Beijing long before you were born, and 
      I've never seen anyone as rude as you are. Your job is to serve the 
      customers , not to insult them. Now for the last time are you going to 
      show me the tea or not?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And for the last time I am telling it to you. 
      Either buy it or get out of here! I know the likes of you-you want 
      something good, and yet grudge the money you have to spend on it!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is insufferable 1 Who is in charge here? I 
      want to see your head ! &quot; &quot;My head? It's on my shoulders. Take a 
      good look if you want to. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man went away fuming. &quot;I've got down your 
      number ber. I'll write to the Evening News. &quot; The threat didn't seem 
      to frighten the girl. At most she'll have to make a self-criticism, which 
      costs her nothing. Even if she should lose a month's bonus, it is only a 
      few yuan. But if she could be sacked, I bet she wouldn't dare to be so 
      rude and aggressive.</font></p>

      Text B<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the housewives who went to the new supermarket had 
      one great ambition: to be the lucky customer who did not have to pay for 
      her shopping. For this was what the notice just inside the entrance 
      promised. It said; &quot;Remember, once a week, one of our customers gets 
      free goods. This may be your lucky day ! &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several weeks Mrs Edwards hoped , like many of her 
      friends, to be the lucky customer. Unlike her friends, she never gave up 
      hope. The cupboards in her kitchen were full of things which she did not 
      need. In vain her husband tried to dissuade suade her. She dreamed of the 
      day when the manager of the supermarket<br>
      would approach her and say:&quot;Madam, this is your lucky day. Everything 
      in your basket is free. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Friday morning, after she had finished her shopping 
      and had taken it to her car, she found that she had forgotten to buy any 
      tea. She dashed back to the supermarket, got the tea<br>
      and went towards the cashdesk. As she did so, she saw the manager of the 
      supermarket approaeh her. &quot;Madam&quot; , he said, holding out his 
      handzs, &quot;I want to congratutate you! You are our lucky customer and 
      everything you have in your hasket is free!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three times a man in his early 30s approached Shen 
      Limin's clothes counter in the Baihua Garment Store on busy Xidan Street 
      in central Beijing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time Shen showed him the various garments. He 
      left but returned a while later and stood there staring at a skirt. Then 
      he went away again, but came back after a few minutes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curious, Shen asked, &quot;Why don't you buy that skir 
      since you love it so much?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man said that he really wanted to, but the 198-yuan 
      price was too much for him. She suggested that he choose something 
      cheaper, but he replied that the skirt was what his wife would like most.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They started talking and he told her he bought his wife 
      a gift every year in celebration of their wedding anniversary. Shen was so 
      moved that she offered the skirt to him for 130 yuan, the wholesale price.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the man hesitated in surprise, she told h'sm, 
      &quot;I do that simply because<br>
      you are a good husband. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a divorcee, Shen, 35, spoke from the depths of her 
      heart.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could not imagine any husband being so considerate 
      or tender.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her failure in marriage and her divorce three years ago 
      scared her away men and prompted her to resign from her job as a log 
      keeper in a film studio and become a self-employed garment seller.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes Shen unusual is that she make money to help 
      deserted ids.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her love of children and her sympathy for the wretched 
      stemmed fiom the day her six-year-old younger brother was crushed to death 
      in a mishap in a warehouse near her home.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sympathetic nature kept her marriage together for 
      seven years.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband had been a clarinet player in an army band. 
      A go-between had introduced them. One cold snowy night they deeided to get 
      married. He had been walking her home and kept darting into shops. She 
      grew impatient thinking he was merely wanting to buy cigarettes and she 
      stomped off. But he ran after her and presented her with a gauze mask he 
      had bought. for her to help keep out the cold.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughtfulness moved her to tears. He said that 
      perhaps they should break up since she cotild not understand him. &quot;I 
      will marry you if that can atone for my mistake,&quot; Shen said she 
      responded. And so the matter was sealed.<br>
      The death of a bosom fiiend seven years later marked the beginning of the 
      end for Shen and her husband.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the friend lay dying of heart disease. 20 days after 
      giving birth to a son-a pregnancy she had risked because her husband was 
      the only son of hi, family-she asked Shen to care for the child.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen promised she would, even though she had a son of 
      her own. Her husband was strongly opposed, however. Still. Shen would 
      often go to see the child, who was living in his grandmother's home.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I felt guilty when I saw the child wearing dirty 
      clothes,&quot; Shen said.&quot; I thought the child would not have been 
      like that had his mother been alive. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the grandparents decided to send the boy to 
      friends in Tianjin, Shen wanted to adopt him. Her husband then moved out 
      and said he wanted a divorce.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen went to Tianjin to look for the child and found 
      him. But the family refused to give the boy up. Shen would not leave until 
      she was convinced the child was being kindly treated and properly cared 
      for.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her years of marriage had given Shen a comfortable 
      life-style but that was all, she said. The divorce made her realize'she 
      had feelings and ambitions again.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen had once dreamed of becoming a film actress, and 
      tried out for roles but only ended up with bit parts. She fared better on 
      the stage with amateur troupes. But her dreams were shattered when she was 
      refused admission to a professional art school because of her age. She was 
      too old to learn how to act , she was told.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New dreams filled the void of her disappiontment. She 
      turned to helping children. She wrote to the SOS Village in Tianjin, a 
      home for orphaned children, applying for a job as a nurse. But she was 
      turned down because she had a son.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She still wanted to help children but did not know how. 
      Finding a way to make money became a practical and urgent problem. Eerly 
      last year she started her own business as a clothing dealer, setting up a 
      stall in west Beiing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother did not like the idea and felt it would be 
      bad fos.her grandson to be brought up in such an environment. She 
      threatened to smash the stall, but gradually Shen won her over.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't want my son to follow my example,&quot; 
      she said. &quot; expect a lot of him. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She still maintains contact with her friend's son in 
      Tianjin.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She moved to Xidan this summer when the new Baihua 
      Garment store pened. She now has two assistants , one of them a university 
      graduate.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen said that her business life has made her a 
      different woman, one vho is independent and full of confidence. Friends 
      try to get her to date but she is not interested.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, she said, her distaste of marriage or love 
      affairs was so strong that she cut her hair short and wore men's clothes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am afraid of falling in love.&quot; Shen said 
      with a bitter smile.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She daubts whether she eauld be a good wife , saying 
      she woutd better as a friend or companion.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of her customers have become friends. To one 
      frequent calkr, she is Sister Shen.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I really love my customers,&quot; Shen said. 
      &quot;I do my business for the sake<br>
      of love. &quot;<br>
