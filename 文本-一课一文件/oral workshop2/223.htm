      All For a Son<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The desire for a son and heir is common to all mankind. 
      In our country, especially, to have as many male descendents as possible 
      has always been regarded as the greatest blessing in life. The failure to 
      produce a male heir was considered the most unfilial of all unfilial 
      crimes. A man was justified to cast away his wife and take another if she 
      failed to bear him a son. For the rich, the problem could be solved by 
      taking a concubine or several concubines.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All traditional ideas die hard. The desire for ason is 
      as strong as ever, and the problem has been aggravated by our onechild 
      family planning policy. Hence the numerous tragedies and comedies we hear 
      and read so often. There are fathers who drop down in a faint when they 
      hear their wives have given birth to daughters. There are 
      &quot;guerrilla&quot; couples who roam from place to place dodging family 
      planning officials to give one birth after another until they finally have 
      a son.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">But more often we 
      hear of tragedies of wives being ill treated by their husbands and by 
      their parents-in-law because they failed to give birth to sons. Recently I 
      saw a photograph in Yangcheng Evening showing a woman with a baby in her 
      arms appealing to passers-by in the street. The caption says she is 
      telling people of her plight of being thrown out into the street with her 
      baby girl by her husband'sfamily, all because she has given birth to a 
      daughter instead of a son. I remember some time ago reading about a man 
      pushing his three-year-old daughter down a well.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Fortunately 
      the girl was saved by someone who happaned to pass by. The man only got a 
      year and a half imprisonment for attempted murder. To my mind , he was 
      just as guilty as if the girl had really drowned.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By comparison, the story of Zhou Chenghu, an ordinary 
      farmer of Changning County in Sichuan Province arouses more ridicule than 
      indignation.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhou's parents had died when he was still young, and he 
      was the only son to carry on the family line. He had married early when he 
      was only twenty. The first child was a girl, so he tried again, and the 
      second child born the following year was also a girl. Zhou was vexed but 
      still not unduly worried, but when the third birth turned out to be a girl 
      too, he could sit tight no more. He began to consult doctors, quacks, 
      witches, and fortune-tellers.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">One geomancer 
      told him that his ancestral graves were wrongly located, so he dug up his 
      mother's grave and had her remains reburied. But that didn't seem to help 
      him as he had a fourth daughter. Now really desperate he disturbed the 
      dead again and had his father reburied this time. But it seemed nothing 
      could help, for the fifth was still a daughter. In the meantime he had 
      incurred upon himself heavy fines for violating family planning 
      laws.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Another geomancer 
      told him that the gods would help him if he had a temple archway built. 
      What would he not do as long as he could get a son? So no expenses were 
      spared and he did as the geomancer told him. But the gods remained unmoved 
      and gave him another girl. As the newborn baby uttered her first cry upon 
      entering this world, her father began to wail most miserably.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was now a bitterly disappointed and broken man. He 
      became a heavy drinker. He habitually beat up his wife and daughters for 
      no reasons at all. He had nothing to live for. He felt he could not look 
      people in the face because he had no son. When the whole village had 
      electric lights installed, he had to go without because he had no rnoney. 
      In fact, his debts ran to four figures and he could see no way of repaying 
      them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one day early this year, after loading himself 
      heavy with drink, Zhou Chenghu ended his own miserable life at the age of 
      forty. Perhaps he was not as guilty as the man who tried to drown his own 
      daughter, but to leave his wife and six daughters to fend for themselves, 
      though no crime was certainly not excusable. And all because he had no 
      son!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ignoring family planning policies and siring 
      three girls Zhang, who lives in a village in Henan Province, finally got 
      the son he was waiting for this year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the heavy fines exacted for breaking the 
      regulations on family planning, Zhang was overjoyed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The honest and simple peasant does not hesitate when 
      asked why he so much desired a son. &quot;Why? Who'll support me when I 
      get old?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually there are some homes for old folks in the 
      village and nearby. But though he supposes they live well there, Zhang 
      still does not believe the old folks are happy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's just so-so there. Wlio knows what it'll be 
      like over there when I get old. It's better to have a son,&quot; Zhang 
      said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a son-in-law cannot be depended on to support him, 
      says Zhang.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A son-in-law who lives with his wife's family is looked 
      down on by the community. He cannot be expected to replace a naturalson.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A family nearby ha's four sons. Life became very hard 
      when the two older sons got married. However., the third son says he would 
      rather be a bachelor for life than risk having to take in some day his 
      wife's aged parents.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As China's family planning programme enters the 1990s, 
      traditional ideas on family life are posing the major barriers to limiting 
      China's population.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ideas have formed over thousands of years.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of &quot;more sons, more happiness&quot; 
      still exists in some rural areas , especially in poor and remote ones.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some families, the presence of several sons gives 
      parents a feeling of protection. Families with no boys , or few boys, may 
      feel intimidated by families with many sons.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem the country must face is early 
      marriages. A survey in a town in Zhecheng County shows young people 
      marrying earlier than the law prescribes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are engaged by the age of 15. Parents dream of 
      grandchildren,<br>
      and sometimes they encourage early marriages, ignoring the government's 
      call for &quot;marriage at mature ages &quot;.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing these ideas is hard as tens of millions of 
      peasants are illiterate.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang is a school teacher in Shimen in east Sichuan. At 
      36 he was still a lonely bachelor and was likely to remain one until one 
      day towards the end of 1988 he happened to read in the matrimonial column 
      of a magazine an advertisement which read; Yang, a woman of 31 who is a 
      family planning officer in a certain township in south Sichuan, seeks a 
      reliable and understanding man for a spouse having been disappointed in 
      her first love affair by the man she has lost her heart to . . . '</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow this advertisement appealed to Wang greatly. 
      After much thought he plucked up his courage and wrote to this woman Yang. 
      It was first love letter he had written in his life. To his surprise and 
      great joy he got a very warm response. Things went so smoothly in fact 
      that very soon the woman appeared before him in flesh and blood, with a 
      divorce certificate in her 6and to prove that she was a free woman and was 
      sincere in .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;her desire 
      to marry him. Wang could hardly believe in his own luck, and so with great 
      haste he said good-bye to his bachelor life. On the wedding night , 
      however, he got a great shock when he discovered that his bride was 
      already three months pregnant. But he was a reasonable man, and instead of 
      blaming her he did his best to console her, assuring her that nothing 
      could alter his love for her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was as good as his words , so the newly-wed 
      couple lived in harmony and bliss until half a year later when Yang gave 
      birth to a lovely plump son. Wang cared for the mother and child as if he 
      was the real father.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on the day of the full month of the baby, Wang 
      came home from school to find that his wife had prepared a small 
      feast.Overjoyed and teuched by this show of affection,he nevertheless 
      admonished her for overtiring herself while secretly congratulating 
      himself for having found such a considerate and loving wife.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, before he had finished eating and with the wine 
      still warm in his heart , Yang suddenly said to him : &quot;Happily we got 
      together, now let us gladly part!&quot; Wang could hardly believe his 
      ears. &quot;Please don't talk such nonsense!&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm not talking nonsense. We have to divorce. To 
      be quite honest, I don't find it easy leaving you like this, and I feel 
      very sad having cheated you. You are a very good man. But I was a happily 
      married woman with a lovely daughter. Our only regret was having no son. 
      What were we to do? I couldn't very well give a second birth, especially 
      as I am a family planning officer.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">So my husband and 
      I worked out this plan ...We agreed to divorce temporarily after having 
      made sure I was prcgnant again. I had secretly gone to see a doctor and he 
      had given me hope that it was likely going to be a boy, and so we went 
      ahead with our plan. After I put out fhe advertisement, I got many offers 
      We picked on you for two reasons. First, you are a teacher and therefore 
      are likely to be a reasonable man and would not make things difficult for 
      me. Secondly, you are no longer so young and would not be too choosy and 
      therefore would readily take me ... Now you know all. Say whatever you 
      like. Curse me, call me names ... All I ask is that you forgive me and let 
      me go back to my former husband.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang was dumb-founded. In vain he tried to plead and 
      remonstrate, and begged her to stay. But Yang was adamant. &quot;I still 
      love my former husband.<br>
      Our divorce was not for real in the first place. If you don't let me go. 
      you can only keep my body, but you can't keep my heart. I had madeit clear 
      in my advertisement that I had lost my heart to my first love!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end the good, honest Wang had to agree to 
      divorce hcr and let her go. Left alone again, Wang thought not only of the 
      injury done to himself,but the deceit and trickery on the part of the 
      couple to dodge the law, and the woman was supposed to be some sort of 
      officer of the law too. Could such a monstrous thing be allowed? Was the 
      force of feudal ideas so much stronger than the force of law?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may well ask the same questions.</font></p>
