      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were at the terminus and as a bus had just left, 
      there were only the two of us. &quot;We're sure to get good seats,&quot; I 
      thought to myself confidently. But soon there was a crowd and nobody 
      seemed to have the least intention of forming a line. In fact everybody 
      was trying to crane forward and soon they were almost standing in the 
      middle of the road so as to be in the best strategic position.&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">I realized I had 
      been over-optimistic about getting seats. So I said to Granny: &quot;You 
      get on in your own good time, Granny. I'll get on first to find a seat for 
      you. &quot; She was terifified at the idea : &quot;Oh no , you don't ! 
      Never mind about the seat. The important thing is to get on the bus. I'll 
      never manage it by myself. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at all the young men around us, I realized 
      Granny was right. All the young men had intent faces just like soldiers 
      ready to go into action. And when a bus did finally arrive, everybody 
      rushed forward to meet it so as to be just in front of one of the doors, 
      and people ran along with the bus, keeping as near to a door as possible 
      until finally the bus came to a halt and the doors opened.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">The mad scramble 
      that followed defies description. It was almost a free-for-all: people 
      fought, jostled, pushed and elbowed their way forward, accompanied by 
      shouts and curses all around. I had great difficulty in pushing Granny 
      into the bus. I was really afraid that her old bones might crack Had a lot 
      of difficulties in getting on myself too. People behin me pushed, people 
      beside me elbowed, and people in front of m seemed to have formed a block 
      of solid wall.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Actually there wa 
      plenty of roam in the bus. After all the seats had been taken people who 
      got on just stood near the doorway and refused t move in, blocking the way 
      for all those behind who had not ye got on. After what seemed to me to be 
      an eternity of pushin and shouting, all the passengers managed to get on 
      and th doors finally closed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I looked 
      around, hoping somebody woul have the decency to give up his seat to 
      Granny. But they a seemed to be glued to their seats, those 
      &quot;elegantly&quot; dresse young men and ladies, looking happy and smug, 
      apparentl proud of the fact that they were smart enough to be ahead c 
      everybody else.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the bus started, Granny began to wobble on her 
      feet and I had to hold her tight to prevent her from falling. &quot;Will 
      someone be kind enough to give the old lady a seat?&quot; The conductress 
      called out several times , meeting no response. Some seemed to have 
      suddenly dozed off, and others seemed to be captivated by something very 
      interesting outside the bus window.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      In the end it was a middle-aged lady who stood up and gave Granny her 
      seat. After thanking the lady, I helped Granny sit down and looked at 
      those &quot;elegant&quot; young people again, trying to detect some traces 
      of shame on their faces. But I found none.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vietnam? Isn't that a shame? (Laughs softly. ) I saw a 
      file on Vietnam, it showed the actual fighting. It looked ridiculous, just 
      a bunch of kids. It was actually embarrassing to watch that, people were 
      actually shooting and shouting. I saw Vietnam. .I looked at a map once. 
      I'm concerned with Vietnam if my brother has to go, otherwise, no.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My interest in life is me. It's a shame. I wish I could 
      pick up a newspaper and read it. What I hear about things is heard from 
      other people.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope I'll make it. I think it's marriage, to someone 
      who is successful. Highland Park, a couple of kids. I'm not too crazy 
      about children, though. You're sitting in a room, and all of a sudden five 
      kids'll come in and they'll go to another girl in the room. Same with 
      dogs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm worried about the next couple of years. Here I'm 
      putting all this time and feeling into this relationshp with Steven, and 
      to have it not work out, it would be terrible. I don't know what I'd do. 
      I'd probably find someone else and be just as happy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to have war, there's been wars through all the 
      ages , apparently everyone gets enjoyment out of it. If we removed</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      this part from man, it would be boring. Otherwise things would be sort of 
      dull.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love my building, I just love it. If I'm on a bus 
      going to my mother's, I look at these people and get a nauseous feeling. 
      On Michigan Avenue, I rospect them more. Home gives me a sick feeling.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lt's a shame Blacks don't like me and children don't 
      like me and dogs don't run up to me.<br>
      <br>

      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago, a newspaper column caught my attention. 
      It was the first time since I came to America that I read about an issue 
      similar to the ones I often heard in China.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started'from a letter sent to a newspaper column 
      by a woman named Sally from Toronto, Canada. She told the columnist about 
      her unpleasant experience on a bus ride in Canada. She was in the late 
      stage of her pregnancy, with very swollen ankles. Howevei, people on the 
      bus just pretended not to notice her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The responses to 5ally's letter, in the columnist's 
      words were &quot;staggering&quot;, and many of them were 
      &quot;unpredictable&quot;.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost all the women readers, of course, gave their 
      understanding and sympathy to Sally. A woman who signed her name as 
      &quot;L. M. &quot; related Sally's experience with her own. She told the 
      columnist that she had used public transportation for ll years in Detroit 
      and never saw a man give his seat t0 a pregnant woman. She pointed out, 
      however, women passengers did it all the time.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;As for her 
      own experience, she once offered a seat to another pregnant woman when she 
      herself was in her seventh month pregnancy. When the other woman sat down 
      and said to L. M. , &quot;Bless you for saving my life&quot;, the man 
      sitting next to her &quot;turned red as a tomato&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people think that nowadays in America, a lot of 
      men were raised with no manners. A woman reader from California wrote 
      about what she once saw on a bus and implied that parents should be strict 
      with their children's behavior. She was sitting behind a mother and a 
      teenage son. An elderly lady got on the bus and stood near the boy, 
      struggling to stay upright.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      The boy was engrossed in his comic book when his mother poked him and 
      ordered him to give his seat to that elderly woman. The Californian woman 
      thought the mother was doing a fine job bringing up her son.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men readers, however, responded to Sally differently. 
      Some of them have long resented at women's equal rights campaigns, and 
      took this opportunity to get back at women. Here is what a man from 
      Anchorage, Alaska wrote: This is for Sally in Toronto who figures she is 
      entitled to g seat on the bus because she is seven months pregnant: Get 
      real, lady, this is the '90s. You women have been screaming about equal 
      rights , so now you've got them. Live with your equal rights and stop 
      beefing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reader from Philadelphia claimed he learned his 
      lesson trom an experience on a bus. This is what he wrote in his letter 
      published in November, 1990: The last time I offered a woman a seat on the 
      bus was in 1972 She glared at me and said. &quot;Do I look helpless?&quot; 
      I replied, &quot;No, but I thought . . . &quot; She cut me off with, 
      &quot;Y'ou thought? The trouble with you chauvinists is that you don't 
      think. Women today don't want a seat on a bus. They want equal pay. &quot; 
      She then launched into a women's liberation lecture. I was never so glad 
      to get off a bus in my life.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also those who are unhappy with life and hate 
      the world in which they are living. Therefore, they used Sally's letter as 
      an opportunity to speak out their mind. A person from Oakland does not 
      think Sally deserves any sympathy. His reason is that overpopulation is a 
      major problem in the universe today and there are other reasons that he 
      dislikes this world. Therefore, he concludes that anyone who would bring a 
      child into this &quot;crazy, mixed-up&quot; world is insane and deserves 
      punishment.<br>
