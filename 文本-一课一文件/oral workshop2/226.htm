        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There Are Two Sides to Everything<br>

        Text A<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a most exasperating and frustrating experience 
        with the hospital today: But Granny had it much worse. First she was the 
        victim of an accident and then she was the suffering patient.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was out shopping early this morning, and was 
        hardly a few scores of yards from our house when she was knocked down hy 
        a bicycle. The rider was a reckiess young man who didn't even stop after 
        the accident, but raced away as though an army was after him. It was a 
        neighbour who recognized her and came to call me (both of my parents 
        were out ).&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">When I heard 
        the news, my heart jumped up to my mouth. I raced downstairs, two or 
        three steps at a time and sprinted to the spot. I never ran so fast in 
        my iife. There I saw a crowd of people. I elbowed my way in, and saw 
        Granny sitting on the ground leaning against a tree, her face all 
        swollen and her mouth bleeding. She was holding her left arm with her 
        right hand. It must be a fracture judging rom the way it hurt her.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some of the 
        crowd were concerned and offering help and advice, but most were just 
        curious onlookers.omeone managed to stop a passing car for us, and the 
        driver kindly drove us to the nearest hospital. Then our ordeal began.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally I took her to the emergericy room first and 
        expected immediate attention. But we had to wait for at least ten 
        minutes before a doctor came over to us. I-Ie just took a brief look at 
        her and said simply: &quot;Go to the dental department. &quot; &quot;But 
        doctor, aren't you going to give her a thorough check?&quot; I asked 
        &quot;Don't worry, her life is not in danger. &quot; Before I could say 
        anything more , he was already out of sight.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing for us to do but look for the 
        dental department which took us a long time because it was on the third 
        floor. There the dentist told us that we must register first, so I had 
        to rush all the way down again to the ground floor, there only to find a 
        long queue. I tried to jump the queue explaining it was an emergency 
        case, &quot;Go to the emergency room if it's an emergency case ! &quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I didn't 
        know whether to laugh or to cry. Anyway I stood obediently at the end of 
        the line and at last when my turn came I was given many forms to fill, 
        some of which were very detailed and quite unnecessary I thought. After 
        filling them I found I had to queue up once again to hand them in! By 
        the time everything was finished and I rushed upstairs, I was happy to 
        find the dentist had the decency not to wait for me before treating 
        Granny. That was the first comforting thing after entering the hospital 
        and I really felt grateful to the dentist. After putting several 
        stitches to lips and gum, the dentist said &quot;That's all. Now go and 
        pay your bill. &quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But doctor, her arm hurts. &quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You have to go to the surgical department for 
        that. It's just opposite. I'll take you there. &quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like the man. But all the same I had to run 
        all the way down to the ground floor to register again for the surgical 
        department. And for all that much trouble the doctor spent less than 
        five minutes examining Granny and sai: &quot;She'll need an X-ray.&quot; 
        He wrote out a chit and that was that.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The X-ray department was on the ground floor and I 
        had to help her all the way down. The complications and rigmarole 
        involved in getting the X-ray done were too complicated and irritating 
        to describe. The long and short of it was, after we got the X-ray 
        picture, I had to take Granny all the way up again to the third floor. 
        After taking a look at it , the doctor said :&quot;No bones broken. I'll 
        prescribe some pain-killer and antibiotics. &quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was all the way down again. The complications 
        in paying the bill and getting the medicine were too silly for words. I 
        had to queue from window to window-to~get the medicine priced and added 
        up , to pay the bill ; to get the medicine. . . And if you didn't know 
        the right order and sequence, which I didn't, it often meant standing in 
        the wrong queue only to be told to come back again after queuing up at 
        another window.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time we got home it was almost one o'clock. We 
        had spent almost four hours at the hospital, and I made a calculation: 
        Five minutes with the doctor in the emergency room, half an hour with 
        the dentist, ten minutes with the surgeon-three<br>
        quarters of an hour all told. The rest of the time was spent waiting, 
        queuing,rushing from place to place. If Granny had had to do all that by 
        herself, she wouldn't have left the hospital alive, I'm sure.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Taxt B<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ding Ping, a bone specialist in No. 2 People's 
        Hospital of Anqing in Anhui Province, won a bronze medal at the 37th 
        International Eureka Fair in Brussels iast year for his invention, a new 
        bone-setting device. Not only the doctor himself vvas happy and honoured 
        . his hospital , indeed the whole city felt honoured and happy too. But 
        who would have thought that his invention not only brought the doctor a 
        bronze medal , but also plunged him into a heavy debt.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started in 1986 when for the whole ycar Dr 
        Ding spent his every spare minute on his new invention. After another 
        year's clinical trial use, the device proved to be effective. So in June 
        last year Dr Ding was informed by the Science Commission of Anhui 
        Province that this invention had been selected to compete<br>
        in the 37th Eureka International Fair.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was indeed happy news, but Dr Ding's happiness 
        was marred by the fact that he had to pay 5, 000 yuan for entering his 
        item for the fair. Where on earth was he to raise such a huge sum? He 
        applied for aid from the Municipal Science Commission but got turned 
        down because firstly the Commission thought his irivention was a private 
        one , the work of an individual and therefore could not be funded by the 
        public, and secondly the Commission was hard up anyway and could not 
        afford to pay out such a large sum.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;So what 
        was to be done? At the last moment his hospital came to the rescue : 
        They agreed to lend Dr Ding 5, 000 yuan, but starting from January this 
        year, they would deduct 50 yuan from his monthly salary until the debt 
        was fully repaid.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ding was grateful and' jumped at the chance. But 
        he was under no illusion about the predicamentz2 he was plunging himself 
        into. His salary was only 97 yuan a month. His wife, a school teacher, 
        only brought home 82 yuan a month. With two daughters at school their 
        life was not easy as it was. To have 50 yuan deducted monthly from their 
        meagre income for the next eight years would mean a financial burden 
        that would surely break the camel's back</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discarding all face problems, Dr Ding started to beg 
        for alms from all quarters. Mostly he met with rebuffs, but he could not 
        afford to give up. After a few months of begging from door to door, he 
        managed to collect 1,400 yuan. Quite a substantial<br>
        sum, but he was still 3,600 yuan short.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The news that his invention had won a bronze medal 
        not only brought some spiritual comfort , but also some material gains. 
        His hospital decided to award him 500 yuan as a token of recognition for 
        his brilliant work. But the fact remains that he still had a debt to 
        pay, now reduced to 3,100 yuan. Again he applied for help from various 
        municipal departments, but so far without success.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Dr Ding and his family going to spend the next 
        five years<br>
        in poverty and misery just because he has invented something useful and 
        won international recognition?<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Additiosal Information</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        It's a hospital scene. People are lining up for registration. After 
        seeing the doetor they come back to line up again for tgeir medicine, Of 
        course it's a very time-consuming process, because they have to get the 
        prescriptions priced at one window and pay at. another. Then at the last 
        window they get their medicine. That means altogether they have to line 
        up at three different windows just to get their medicine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid all this trouble, a smart woman works out 
        the most convenient<br>
        way of getting her medicine. She herself stands at the end of the first 
        line and puts her pram with her baby in it, a toy duck and her own bag 
        at the end of the other three lines. She has them all strung'together 
        with the wool yarn with which she's knitting. She believes this will 
        save her the trouble<br>
        of lining up three times.<br>
