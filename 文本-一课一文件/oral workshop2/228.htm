      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked into the office and shook hands with a smiling 
      man named Mr Bleaucher. He was dressed very well, compared to me. He 
      shuffled a pile of papers like they were so many pancakes.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sure you'll be very pleased with her,&quot; 
      he said. &quot;She was picked by our compatibility computer out of over 
      one hundred ten million eligible women in the United States. We categorize 
      by race, religion, ethnic and regional background. . . &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat there interestedly, wishing I had taken a shower 
      before I came. It was a very nice office but the chair wasn't too 
      comfortable.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And now . . . &quot; he said. He flung open the 
      door to the next room like a magician. He needed a cape , though. I was 
      expecting a rabbit but I got a surprise.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was pretty. Really, she was pretty.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mr Walker, this is Miss Dunfield of Laughing 
      Lake, Montana.<br>
      Miss Dunfield, this is Mr Franklin Walker of New York. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Really Frank. Franklin is something else 
      again,&quot; I said. I<br>
      was a little nervous. She was pretty, you see.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Bleaucher left and we were able to talk. 
      &quot;Hello. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hello,&quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm ... I'm very pleased with the choice,&quot; I 
      said. I was trying to be suave. Maybe she didn't like being called a 
      choice. &quot;I mean - I'm glad the way things turned out. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled. She had a nice smile. Good teeth.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;So am I. &quot; 
      She was shy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm thirty-one,&quot; I blurted out.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes , I know , &quot; she said. &quot;It's all on 
      the cards. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed like the conversation was about over. 
      Everything was on the cards. So there wasn't really much to talk about.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How about children?&quot; she said.<br>
      .&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Three. Two boys and a girl. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's exactly what I want,&quot; she said. 
      &quot;It's down on the file under `Future Planning' . That one there. 
      &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suddenly noticed that sheaf of papers in my hand. On 
      the first page was glued an IBM card with vital statistics about her. I 
      guessed the thing she was holding was the same thing on me. I began 
      looking through it and so did she. The turning pages made a lot of noise.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It said she liked classical music. (This was in 
      &quot;Preferences and Habits&quot;. )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You like classical music?&quot; I asked her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well. . . better than anything else. I also have 
      the complete collection of Frankie Laine records. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He was a great old singer,&quot; I agreed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went on looking through the file and so did she. She 
      liked books , football , sitting near the front in movies , sleeping with 
      the windows closed, dogs, cats, goldfish, tuna fish, salami sandwiches, 
      simple clothes, private schools for the children (our children, really), 
      living in the suburbs, art museums. ...<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up. &quot;It seems we like the same things , 
      &quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The exact same things , &quot; I said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the report titled &quot;Psychology&quot;. She 
      was shy, avoided arguments, wasn't outspoken, a good mother type.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm glad you don't drink or smoke,&quot; she 
      said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't. I don't like to. Sometimes I have beer, 
      though. &quot; &quot;It doesn't say so down here. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, maybe I forgot to put that down. &quot; I 
      hoped she didn't mind.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finished reading the reports on each other. 
      &quot;We're very much alike , &quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice and I have been married for nine years now. We 
      have the three kids already, two boys and a girl. We live in the suburbs<br>
      and listen to a lot of classical and Frankie Laine records. The last time 
      we had an argument is too far back to remember. We agree on practically 
      everything. She's been a good wife and, if I may say so, I've been a good 
      husband. Our marriage is perfect.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're getting divorced next month. I can't stand it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mum's first attempt at match-making ended in dismal 
      failure. People say as a woman approaches middle age, she interests 
      herself in young people's love affairs and likes match-making. If this is 
      true, I hope this first failure would discourage Mum from acquiring such 
      an interest.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really don't know why she should have gone to such 
      lengths to try to bring those two young people together. It was a 
      fruitless and thankless job, doomed from the start because both parties 
      put impossible demands on the opposite side. The man, Xiao Liu, is about 
      thirty and works in Mum's office, apparently a very promising young man 
      with an M. A. degree.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Because he is 
      very choosy he has never been able to find a wife and is beginning to get 
      worried as he will soon be over thirty. The girl works in Dad's office and 
      is twenty-eight. She is also a college graduate and very good at her work. 
      She is quite pretty and has a very strong character. She too has not been 
      able to find a husband because she is too choosy. Mum had thought 
      innocently that however choosy they might have been, they would surely be 
      satisfied this time. So she invited them over to meet in our house. She 
      even went to the trouble of cooking them a delicious dinner.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      But Mum's pairis were not rewarded. I don't know how they appreciated 
      Mum's dinner, liut they certainly didn't appreciate each other. Xiao Wu 
      could only meet two of Xiao Liu's numerous demands. She is pretty and she 
      has a college degree. But besides that he also wants the girl to be under 
      twenty-five, to be gentle and docile, a periect housewife. He thought Xiao 
      Wu had too strong a character and that he wouldn't be able to 
      &quot;control her &quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">On the other hand 
      he fared even worse in Xiao Wu's eyes, having met only one of her demands. 
      He is a post-graduate student which is one of her prerequisites for a 
      future hus band, and this seems to be the only thing in his favour. She 
      wants her future husband to be an overseas Chinese, or at least to have 
      relatives overseas , so that she could go abroad someday.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Also she wants 
      the man to be around l. 75m in height and Xiao Liu is only 1. 68m. I've 
      heard people say that nowadays, girls consider any young man under 1. 7m 
      as a semi-handicapped, Thank God; I'm already l. 73m and with any luck I 
      can grow another 5cm - a most respectable height. But I don't have any 
      relatives abroad though!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mum was most annoyed, and put all the blame on the 
      girl. &quot;What more does she want? She should realize that she's already 
      28 and she'll never find such an eligible young man again. &quot; Mum 
      never mentioned a word about Xiao Liu's own objections.&quot;Who told you 
      to help such an arrogant young man? Xiao Wu is a hundred times better than 
      he is. Any sensible young man would have jumped at the chance. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Jump at the chance ! I bet you wish you could 
      jump at the chance yourself ! &quot;<br>
      Dad didn't know whether to laugh or to be angry.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 50-year-old woman could not help crying when she 
      heard a story written by her husband over the radio, recalling the early 
      days of their marriage.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story by Shen Lijun, a senior lecturer at the 
      Changsha Commercial School in this capital of Hunan Province , depicted 
      how he , then a college graduate, met and married his wife, Long Huilan, 
      when he was labelled a right-winger and forced to work in a neighbourhood 
      factory in the 1960s.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen said, &quot;In those days, I dared not fall in 
      love with any girls because of my inferior political status, and married 
      the first girl who was willing. &quot; The couple confessed they did have 
      differences of interests.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Shen became a lecturer, most of his visitors were 
      intellectuals, Long said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;After serving them a cup 
      of tea, I had nothing to say and sat aside. Because of their cultural 
      background, I could not get a word in edgeways during the chats. By and 
      by, I came to see a gap between us. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Shen, he and his wife also had different 
      ways to teach their children. &quot;I did not like the way she treated our 
      children: spoiling them and then beating them if they did not study well 
      or listen to her.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But whenever I come across contradictions with my 
      wife in daily life,&quot; Shen explained, &quot;I like to recall those 
      days of hardship we shared together, and this has become a spiritual 
      support to us. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen is a typical example among the middle-aged people 
      in China , an official<br>
      of the Changsha City Radio said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The radio has opened a special programme to help 
      middle-aged couples deepen their love by reviewing the past and exchanging 
      experiences. The programme has become popular with listeners and has 
      received hundreds of letters from people from all walks of life.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He Yingcai, a judge of the Hunan Provincial Higher 
      People's Court, said middle-aged couples account for one third of those 
      married in the province. Traditionally, the marriage of young people was 
      arranged by their parents and couples paid more attention to each other's 
      family background and political affiliation than their own feelings.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, many couples have no feelings for each 
      other, though they have been married for years.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to statistics, about one quarter of the 27, 
      000 couples divorced last year were middle-aged.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rong Xiuqin, an official of the Hunan Provincial 
      Women's Federation,said although the divorce rate among middle-aged people 
      is lower than among people of other ages, this does not mean that their 
      family lives are harmonious. For the sake of their children, many people 
      try to make the best of it.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is our duty to.help them form harmonious 
      families because social stability depends on the stability of 
      families,&quot; she said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tang Xiying, a sociologist specializing in marriage and 
      women, noted that Chinese families may not be.formed on the basis of 
      feelings, but feelings for each other are the key to stabilizing a family.<br>
