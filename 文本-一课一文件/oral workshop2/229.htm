      The Voices of Time<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time talks. It speaks more plainly than words. Time 
      communicates in many ways.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the different parts of the day, for example. 
      The time of the day when something is done can give a special meaning to 
      the event. Factory managers in the United States fully realize the 
      importance of an announcement made during the middle of the morning or 
      afternoon that takes eveiyone away from his work. Whenever they want to 
      make an important announcement, they ask; &quot;When shall we let them 
      know?&quot;</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States, it is not custorriary to 
      telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in 
      the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call 
      shows that the matter as very important and requires immediate attention 
      The same meaning is attached to telephone call after 11. 00 P. M. if 
      someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it is a matter 
      of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its 
      importance.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In social life, time plays a very irrrportant part. In 
      the United States, guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the 
      invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before 
      the party date. But this is not true in all countries. In other areas of 
      the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in 
      advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend 
      to be forgotten.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meanings of time dif#er .in different parts of the 
      worid. Thus, misunderstandings arise;; .between people from cuitures that 
      treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American iife, for 
      example. If people are nvt prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not 
      fully responsible. In the U. S. , no one would think of kee.ping a 
      business associate waiting for an hour, it wouid be too impolite. When 
      equals meet, a person who is five minutes late will say a #ew words of 
      explanation, though perhaps he may not complete the sentence.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans look ahead and are concerned almost entirely 
      with the future. The American idea of the future is limited, however. It 
      is the foreseeable future and not the future of the Soath Asian, which may 
      involve centuries. Someone has said of the South Asian idea of time : 
      &quot;Time is like a museum with endless halls and rooms. You, the viewer, 
      are walking through the museum in the dark, holding a light to each scene 
      as you pass it. God is in charge of the museum, and only he knows all that 
      is in it. One lifetime represents one room. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since time has such different meanings in different 
      cultures, communication is ofte.n difficuit. We will understand each other 
      a little better if we can ksep this fact in mind.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a member of a small, nearly extinct minority group 
      who insist, even though it seems to be out of date, on the sanctity of 
      being on time.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is to say that we On-timers are compulsively, 
      unfashionably prompt, that there are only handfuls of us left, and, 
      unfortunately, we never seem to have appointments with each other.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that being on time has become a social 
      mistake.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that generally speaking, the time that the 
      Late-people set as the Moment of Rendezvous is a code. It is a code 
      meaning at least one half-hour later. The fact is that we Ontimers can't 
      get that into our heads.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrive invariably at the appointed hour at people's 
      houses, which means that we have occasionally eaten'all the sandwiches 
      before the other guests arrive. Which means that we are rude.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain. We are, for example, invited for dinner 
      at eight o'clock at the home of friends who live exactly twenty minutes 
      away. We leave our house at ten to eight so that for once we will be a 
      comfortable ten minutes late. Then even the traffic defeats us. We meet 
      only green lights and arrive at four minutes to eight. We drive about for 
      a while and then enter at one minute past , to the astonishment of the 
      host and hostess.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is at an important stage of preparation with the 
      saucepans. He is thinking about taking a shower.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We end up helping with the first course and putting the 
      baby to hed and mixing the drinks and are still left with enough time to 
      analyse what kind of people our hosts are from the magazines on the coffee 
      table.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for meeting in restaurants , you can immediately 
      recognise us On-timers. We are the only non-alcoholics standing in 
      restaurant doorways in December. If not, we can always be found killing 
      time in the cloakroom or trying to look as if we are not alone at the bar.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we all know that these very same Late-people do 
      not routinely miss planes or the beginnings of films. But, as I told a 
      late-person recently, &quot;If I were a train, I'd be gone. . . &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to meetings there are two kinds of peoplc. 
      Those who hate to wait and those who hate to make others wait. The sadists 
      and the masochists? I hope not.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a New York magazine piece once about the 
      power struggle involved in business lunches. It intimated that you could 
      always tell the powerless and the powerful. The Indians were waiting, 
      while the Chiefs arrived half an hour or an hour later. If you are an 
      On-timer, you cannot make an entrance.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Late-people, of course, are always terribly sorry, 
      &quot;but something important came up&quot; (in contrast to us, for 
      instance). Besides, as they say, their minds are always so full of big 
      questions (like The Bomb) that they never know what time it is. In 
      comparison with the On-timers , 'they suggest , who have their little 
      brains filled with stupid details like the big hand and the little hand on 
      the clock.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is getting worse. If you adjust to the 
      Late-people and accept the fact that they're half an hour behind the time 
      you arranged to meet , they arrive an hour late.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fewer and fewer of us On-timers remain. We are now 
      surprised when anyone else is on time. We have begun to make certain 
      adjustments like setting our clocks and watches back or bringing the novel 
      we're working on to dinner parties.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How late we are to recognise that being on time is out 
      of date, that in fact, our time has passed.<br>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      How Americans See Time<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans recognise that there is a past on which the 
      present rests.But they have not developed their sense of the depth of time 
      to the extent that this has been done in the Middle East and South Asia. 
      The Arab,looks back two to six thousand years for his own origins. History 
      is used as the basis for almost any modern action. The chances are that an 
      Arab won'r start a talk or a speech or analyse a problem without first 
      developing the historical aspects of his subject. The American assumes 
      that time has depth, but he takes this for granted.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American never questions the fact that time should 
      be planned and future events fitted into a schedule. He thinks that people 
      should look forward to the future and not dwell too much on the past. His 
      future is not very far ahead of him. Results must be obtained in the 
      foreseeable futureone or two years or, at the most, five or ten. Promises 
      to meet deadlines and appointments are taken very seriously.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">There are real 
      penalties for being late and for not keeping commitments in time. The 
      American thinks it is natural to quantify time. To fail to do so is 
      unthinkable. The American specifies how much time is required to do 
      everything. &quot;I'll be there in ten minutes. &quot; &quot;It will take 
      six months to finish that job. &quot; &quot;I was in the Army for four and 
      a half years. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Americans, tike so many other people, also use time 
      as a link that chains events together, If one event occurs on the heels of 
      another, we inevitably try to find a causal relationship between them. 
      If.A is seen in the vicinity of B's murder shortly after the crime has 
      been committed we automatically form a connection between A and B. 
      Conversely, events which are separated by too much. time are difficult for 
      us to connect in our minds. This makes it almost impossible for us as a. 
      nation to engage in long-range planning.<br>
