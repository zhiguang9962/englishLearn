      THE OX<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a hard and conscientiou's worker if you were 
      born in the year of the Ox and you set about everything in a methodical 
      and determined manner.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a strong leader-tough and uncompromising. You 
      know what you want and don't let anything stand in your way! You take 
      responsibilities very seriously and place a great deal of trust in friends 
      and colleagues. But if. you feel someone has let you down, you'll erupt!</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a loner who cherishes your independence. You can 
      be stubborn and obstinate. You're a poor loser who takes setbacks badly. 
      As an Ox, you're often rather studious and not renowned for your sense of 
      humour.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You love tradition and are suspicious of anything new.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your home is very important to you--it's your private 
      sanctuary. You make sure that members of your close-knit family do their 
      share of the work! You're neat and well-organised, and very punctual. 
      Nothing infuriates you more than being kept waiting. Yes , you are a hard 
      task-master !</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the opportunity, you'd live in the country and 
      spend hours pottering around a large garden. Not surprisingly, Oxen do 
      well in agriculture or politics. You are also very gifted in the arts and 
      music and many of you enjoy considerable success as musicians and 
      composers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female Oxen are caring and kind. You're a loving parent 
      and excellent organiser. You're very determined and often get what you 
      want in life !<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincere, loyal and unpretentious, Oxen are very down-toearth 
      characters. You can, however, be rather reserved and some may see you as 
      distant and aloof.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath that quiet nature, though, you're 
      strong-willed and ambitious. So you have the courage of your convictions 
      and are often prepared to stand up for what you believe.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      THE TIGER<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born under the sign of courage, you're charismatic and 
      usually have firm views and beliefs. You do everything with energy and 
      enthusiasm. A highly original thinker, you're nearly always brimming with 
      new ideas.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You adore a challenge and love getting involved. At 
      least once in a lifetime you'll throw caution to the wind and go off and 
      do your own thing. With your restless nature, however, your enthusiasm can 
      soon wane.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're impulsive and sometimes regret your actions-you 
      need to think things through. Fortunately, you're lucky in most 
      enterprises but, when things don't work out, you suffer bouts of 
      depression.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although your life is a series of ups and downs you're 
      very adaptable. With your restless spirit, you rarely stay in one place 
      for long. You're open and honest and hate hypocrisy. So you can be 
      rebellious at times, which can lead you into conflict. You're never one to 
      shrink from arguments.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tigers are natural leaders and you should rise to the 
      top of your profession, though you don't like bureaucracy and hate obeying 
      orders. And despite your great leadership qualities , you can be 
      indecisive and overly sensitive to criticism.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tigresses are lively and witty, and you're great 
      hostesses. You take care over your appearance and are good with children. 
      You have great teachirig qualities , too. You have a very caring and 
      generous nature.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tigers have many commendable qualities and you are 
      often an inspiration for other people. You'll have full and satisfying 
      lives-provided that you can curb those wild excesses!</font></p>

      THE RABBIT<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligent and well-mannered, rabbits prefer a quiet 
      existence so you hate any sort of unpleasantness and will try to steer 
      clear of arguments and disputes. You're a pacifist and tend to have a 
      calming influence on those around you.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your .wide interests you appreciate the arts and 
      finer things in life. You know how to enjoy yourself and gravitate to the 
      best restaurants and night spots.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a witty and intelligent speaker and love being 
      involved in a good discussion, when your views and advice are often 
      sought. You rarely raise your voice in anger and will even turn a blind 
      eye to matters which displease you just to preserve the peace. You can be 
      a sensitive soul and take any form of criticism badly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quiet, efficient worker, you have an extremely good 
      memory. You're often astute in business and finance but hate making quick 
      decisions. You're a planner who doesn't like to take risks. Because 
      you're, conscientious you will do well in your chosen profession-you're an 
      excellent diplomat and would make a good lawyer or shopkeeper. You're a 
      great collector, and many Rabbits derive pleasure from stamps or antiques.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your home is important to you and you spend time and 
      money<br>
      on maintaining and furnishing it. Female Rabbits have caring , considerate 
      natures and you do everything in your power to keep your home happy and 
      loving .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're sociable and enjoy entertaining. With your great 
      ability<br>
      to get the maximum out of your time , you involve yourself in numerous 
      activities but always find time for a chat.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rabbit is usually lucky in life. You often have the 
      happy<br>
      knack of being in the right place at the right time! You're talented and 
      quick witted but sometimes put pleasure before work !</font></p>

      THE DRAGON<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a proud , Iively character born under the 
      Dragon--and you have tremendous self-confidence. Dragons are highly 
      intelligent and you're quick to take advantage of any opportunities that 
      occur. You're a perfectionist who sets yourself high standars- you won't 
      suffer fools gladly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're blunt and forthright, though occasionally

      forget.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You enjoy being in the limelight and you're at your 
      best when confronted by sticky problems. In some respects you're a 
      showman, and you rarely lack an audience. Your views are highly valued and 
      you invariably have something interesting to say!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dragons have considerable energy and you're often 
      prepared to work long and unsocial hours. You can, however, be rather 
      impulsive and don't always consider the consequences of your actions. As 
      you tend to live for the moment, delays irritate you more than anything. 
      You rely tremendously on your own judgment and can be scornful of others' 
      advice.</font></p>

      of admirers who are attracted by your flamboyance and your striking good 
      looks.</font></p>

      and you're often prepared to work extremely hard, though you hate being 
      bound by routine.You do tend to speak your mind , too !<br>

      travelling off the beaten track. Though you're rather demanding, you have 
      many frineds and you're nearly always the centre of attention.</font></p>

      opposite sex. You often have many prrtners before settling down. Then 
      you're loyal and protective<br>
      to your partner, although you still like to maintain a degree of 
      independence<br>
      with interests and hobbies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outgoing female Horses are usually attractive and 
      intelligent, with many interests, particularly outdoors. You love travel, 
      literature, the arts-and really enjoy good conversation. Although you can 
      be stubborn and self-centred , you have a considerate nature and with your 
      sense of humour, usually make a good impression.</font></p>

      THE GOAT<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imaginative and creative, Goats appreciate the finer 
      things of life. With your easy-going nature, you prefer to relax away from 
      pressures. You hate unpleasantness, or being bound by a strict routine. 
      Even so you're a perfectionist who gives your best once you've started on 
      a project.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you need support and encouragement, you prefer to 
      work in a team rather than on your own, when you can get worried and 
      pessimistic. Usually you like to leave major decisions to others but, if 
      you feel strongly, you'll act with precision and strength. You're a 
      persuasive type, and often use your considerable charm to get your own 
      way.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can, however, be rather hesitant about letting your 
      true feelings be known and if you were prepared to be more forthright, 
      you'd find you'd do much better.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite your reserve, you can be the centre of 
      attention in company and become an amusing host and superb entertainer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the signs, you're the most gifted artistically 
      and make a lasting impression in theatre, literature, music or art.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Goats are religious and also have a deep interest 
      in nature.You're nostalgic and keep mementos of childhood and souvenirs of 
      places you've visited. You're also athletic and likely to exeel in sport.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female goats devote a lot of time to the family. You 
      have excellent taste in home furnishings and often use your artistic 
      skills to make clothes. You are great organisers, with a delightful sense 
      of humour, and create a good impression wherever you go.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goats win friends easily and, with the right support, 
      have happy, satisfying<br>
      lives, particularly if you can use your creative skills.</font></p>

      THE MONKEY<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inquisitive and imaginative, Monkeys love to keep an 
      eye on everything going on. You like to be helpful and offer adivce which 
      is usually sensible and reliable.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monkeys are intelligent, well-read and eager to learn. 
      You have a good memory and often make superb linguists. As a convincing 
      talker, you enjoy debates and discussions-your assured manner can be very 
      persuasive. You excel in politics, public speaking, PR work, teaching and 
      anything involving selling.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can be crafty and cunning, too, and occasionally 
      dishonest. You will seize on opportunities to make quick gains.Often you 
      have so much confidence in your abilities that you won't listen to advice.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately for you, you'ie good at solving problems 
      and extricating yourself from hopeless positions. You're a master of 
      self-preservation! With your talent, you can make lots of money but you 
      like to spend, too, on exotic holidays and all sorts of luxuries.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monkeys are original thinkers who easily become bored 
      and distracted. Even so, you're good at organising-sometimes slightly 
      erratically. On the odd occasion when your plans do not quite work out, 
      you're quite happy to shrug your shoulders.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female Monkeys are intelligent and observant. Your 
      views are often highly valued and you usually get your own way. You pay 
      great attention to your appearance. You're a good friend and doting 
      parent-you often marry young.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided Monkeys can concentrate on one thing at a 
      time, you can usually achieve what you want. And should you suffer any 
      disappointments, you're certain to bounce back again!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      THE ROOSTER<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're all rather flamboyant, colourful characters. But 
      you're also meticulous, and excellent at organising. Intelligent and 
      well-read, you have a great sense of humour and love a good debate. You 
      love speaking your mind but your lack of tact can easily damage your 
      reputation. With your volatile nature, you should avoid acting on the spur 
      of the moment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roosters are very dignified and have an air of 
      confidence and authority. You're adept at finance and are capable of 
      making yourself very wealthy. A few of you, though, are notorious 
      spendthrifts.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll often be seen carrying a notebook or scrap of 
      paper around with you as you're constantly writing reminders or noting 
      down important facts in case you forget.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you're ambitious , you're also sometimes 
      unrealistic about your possible achievements. Roosters don't like 
      interference but it would be in your own interests if you listened to 
      others. You're rather self-centred and can be stubborn over relatively 
      trivial matters.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You lead an active social life and usually belong to 
      several clubs. With your caring nature , you try to help as many less 
      fortunate as possible.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're often distinguished in appearance and wear 
      uniforms with great pride. You like publicity and often do well in public 
      relations or any job which brings you into contact with the media. Out of 
      work, you love pottering in the garden.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female Roosters are active, with strong views which you 
      have no hesitation<br>
      in airing. Your home is usually neat as you're supremely efficient. You're 
      usually found in smart, but very practical, outfits.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roosters usually make a lasting favourable impression, 
      but you need to overcome your volatile nature.</font></p>

      THE DOG<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loyal Dogs hold firm views and you're the champion of 
      good causes. You hate any sort of injustice and will do anything to help 
      those less fortunate.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dogs are direct and straightforward-but you can also be 
      stubborn. Still, you're always prepared to listen to the views of others.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      Dogs are good judges of character and very intuitive. You're admired for 
      your integrity and resolute manner. Though you're friendly, you're not a 
      great socialiser. Your idea of a good time is a quiet meal with friends, 
      or a chat by the fire.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're often a marvellous storyteller, quick-witted and 
      alert. You keep calm in a crisis and although you ha've a temper, 
      outbursts are short. You're trustworthy and if you feel let down by 
      someone, you'll rarely forgive or forget.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dogs usually prefer to specialise rather than dabble in 
      different activities.<br>
      You do well in a job where you can be of service to others, like the 
      social services, law and medicine.Motivation is important to you as you 
      can drift through life without ever achieving much. You tend to be a 
      worrier and rather pessimistic.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're nof usually easy to live with, because your 
      moods are changeable and you set high standards. Even so, you're not short 
      of admirers.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female dogs are renowned for your beauty. You're warm 
      and caring,but until you know someone you can be secretive. Often highly 
      intelligent, you tend to be very ambitious. You can also find bargains in 
      the most unlikely places.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A loving and doting pasent, you're rarely happier than 
      when helping someone. Provided you can stop worrying, you'll have a very 
      full life.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      THE PIG<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honest , kind and understanding-that's the Pig. You're 
      a natural peacemaker and will do everything you can to sort out any 
      differences of opinion.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a good talker who hates hypocrisy. You believe 
      firmly in law and order, although you're tolerant and forgiving, too.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pigs are popular and enjoy company. You can be relied 
      on to lend a helping hand at functions and you're a good fund raiser. 
      Hardworking and conscientious , you're respected for your reliability.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're happiest when you're helping others, and you'll 
      give up your own time without hesitation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your wonderful sense of humour, you invariably 
      have a joke or whimsical remark at the ready. You love to please and 
      entertain people and many Pigs find a career in showbiz.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pigs have great difficulty saying &quot;no&quot; to 
      anyone-you can be naive and gullible. Although you're a free spender, you 
      can often be astute with money.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're kept going by your faith and strength of 
      character so you tend to bounce back quickly from setbacks. Pigs are 
      dogged but you're also thickskinned and can shrug off abuse without 
      thought.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a great pleasure-seeker and will happily spend 
      your hard earned cash on a lavish holiday or expensive meal.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shine at small functions but can become withdrawn 
      at larger events. As a creature of comfort, your home is fitted with all 
      the latest appliances.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female Pigs devote all your energies to your family and 
      you try to ensure they want for nothing. Your home will be either very 
      clean or hopelessly untidy. You have very good taste in clothes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided you do not let others take advantage of you, 
      Pigs will go through life making friends and winning admiration.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      THE RAT<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charming, intelligent and popular-if you were born in 
      the year of the Rat you're the life and soul of the party. You make 
      friends easily and people generally feel relaxed in your company.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a hard worker, imaginative and full od ideas, 
      though sometimes lack the confidence to promote your plans. Rats are very 
      observant and make excellent writers and journalists. You are good on any 
      job which brings you into contact with people.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your skills are particularly appreciated in times of 
      crisis, for Rats have an incredible sense of self-preservation. When it 
      comes to finding a way out of an awkward situation, you're certain to be 
      the one who comes up with a solution.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rats love to be where the action is, but when you're in 
      the office you can become a stickler for discipline and routine. You're 
      also an opportunist, constantly on the look-out for ways in which you can 
      improve your wealth--so you're often involved in plans and schemes, 
      sometimes squandering your energy with little to show for it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can appear to be mean with money-in fact you like 
      to keep it in the family. Rats can be most generous to their partners, 
      children and close friends.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also be very generous to yourself and find it 
      difficult to deprive yourself of any luxury that you fancy! You're a 
      hoarder and hate throwing anything away and you're also rather greedy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You love any chance to indulge in conversation. You 
      tend to be indiscrect.<br>
      though, and highly crificalof others. Because Rats are familyoriented, 
      you'll do anything for your nearest and dearest. You're likelhy to have a 
      large family.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female Rara are usually very busy. You are a marvellous 
      hostess for your wide circle of friends. Your home is well-kept and 
      tastefully furnisheci. Although outgoing. you tend to keep your feelings 
      to yourself. With your ability to charm, you'll rarely be without friends.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      B<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike some of the animals you've read about . most 
      human beings are not colourblind. In fact, thei-e is some evidence that 
      our colour preferences are influenced by our characters or the way we
