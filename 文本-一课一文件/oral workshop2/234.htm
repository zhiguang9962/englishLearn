      Isn't It Good to Speak a Foreign Language?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You really are a lucky dog. &quot;<br>
      Many peole assume that admission into the Institute of Foreign Trade means 
      not only a farewell to &quot;unemployment&quot;, but also a hearty 
      handshake with affluence. They say, and I quote, &quot;As soon as you 
      graduate, you will have a fair chance to go abroad. You may fly round the 
      world, see exciting things and exotic places and feel as happy as a lark 
      and as proud as a peacock. &quot;</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't know what to.think when I first came to this 
      institute. Happy? Yes , happy that I had been admitted by this splendid 
      institute of higher learning. I started to dream about the many things I 
      had so excitedly heard from those who like to dream. I fancied myself 
      posted to one of our commercial offices overseas, working in carpeted 
      offices with air-conditioning, and delightful social activities and 
      parties in the evenings. &quot;What would you like, tea or coffee?&quot; I 
      would answer with a nod, &quot;Brazilian coffee with Danish milk please. 
      &quot; And trying to make conversation, I would say, &quot;What lovely 
      Mediterranean weather we are having!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, however, I felt a bit uneasy. Comfort is not 
      the only thing in life, you know. I do care about what people may think of 
      me, particularly those &quot;scholarly&quot; people who might turn up 
      their noses at the mere mention of the word &quot;trade&quot; and frown at 
      me. taking me for a little money-grubbing, vulgar merchant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well. a year at this institute has taught me a great 
      many things.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it is not at all easy to be trained for the 
      foreign trade service. Like the students of all other institutes, you must 
      work hard , be straight in all your dealings , staunchly patriotic , loyal 
      and 100% reliable. You must get a good command of two foreign languages 
      and Chiiiese , and try in every way to broaden the range and scope of your 
      knowledge, which you may have to draw upon in your future work - history, 
      geography, culture and so on and so forth.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite one or two examples to show how important 
      it is to know the customs and culture of different countries.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once , one of our corporations wanted to sell washing 
      machines to Arab countries. In an advertisement to promote sales, strategy 
      demands diagrams instead of written instructions. Dirty clothes went into 
      the machine in the first diagram, a thorough washing was illustrated in 
      the third. Simple and clear. But the result was disastrous. Arabic is 
      written from right to left. How can this corporation expect to promote 
      sales with dirty clothes as a reault of the new machine?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example concerns trade-marks. One of the best 
      batteries produced in China is the &quot;White Elephant&quot; battery. In 
      English, however, &quot;White Elephant&quot; means an object that is 
      useless, overpriced and utterly undesirable. Do you think English 
      -speaking people would be inclined to make a large purchase of this 
      &quot;White Elephant&quot;?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I've come to learn that the life of a foreign 
      trade worker is not exactly what most people think it is. A good foreign 
      trade worker is one who is dedicated to his work. He must have a strong 
      sense of duty and be fully aware that a slight mistake may bring colossal 
      losses to the country both politically and economically. My uncle, for 
      instance, happens to be a foreign trade worker. Since he is very busy, my 
      aunt has to do nearly all the housework. He is often disturbed in his 
      sleep because of the heavy responsibility.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, he 
      goes to dinner parties four times a week, or even twice a day, but his 
      duties as a translator prevent him from partaking in these banquets. I've 
      seen many of his colleagues burning the candle at both ends. They seldom 
      go to theatres. They seldom go to concerts and they can't even afford time 
      to watch a football match which they're very much interested in. They 
      always think of the interests of the people and the country, without a 
      single thought for themselves. So, think of the tasks . think of the 
      responsibility. Shame on those who only think of their personal comfort, 
      of going abroad, drinking toasts and coming back loaded with foreign made 
      articles.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least; I've come to learn that foreign 
      trade plays a substantial role in our national economy. This is done by 
      acquiring from abroad the equipment and technical know-how necessary for 
      our modernization drive and by pushing the sales of our exports which form 
      the material basis of our imports. There arc so many new fields to open up 
      and so many new things to be learned. Four or five years is not cnough. It 
      requires more than one's lifetime.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a student of foreign trade. I feel that my future: 
      job is just as significant and necessary as many other occupations. like 
      the geologists'conquering the deserts, the scientists'tapping the ocean, 
      and the astronauts'exploring the outer space. Instead of going abroad, I 
      may be asked to sit at my desk all my life, collecting<br>
      data, translating or interpreting. Then, &quot;Am I a lucky dog?&quot; 
      Yes. I am lucky that I've become a student of foreign trade. Lucky that 
      I'm conscious of the responsibility of a business woman of New China. 
      I.ucky that I have acquired an initial ability to serve my country and my 
      people heart and soul.</font></p>

      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, I can't help thinking how magic languages 
      are. They are like bridges joining islands - connecting people's minds.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, whenever I am in the classroom, at lectures or 
      practising Engl;sh or French. I often think of my experiences at the llth 
      Asian Games held in Beijing last autumn.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was assigned interpreter to the sports delegation 
      from The Maldives, a small island countrv in the Indian Ocean. When I met 
      the delegation at the Beijing Airport&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was greatly 
      surprised to find they all spoke English fluentIy,We were so excited when 
      we realized that we were talking to each other in a language that was not 
      native to anv of us.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Games, one of &quot;my&quot; delegation, 
      Shijiao, developed some eye trouble. The Games Village doctor thought it 
      was infectious and said he should go to the infectious diseases hospital, 
      and I was asked to take him. A Sikh from the Indian delegation went with 
      us. He was suspected of having hepatitis. At the hospital I helped the 
      doctor and nurse get Shijiao settled down.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, the hospital called to say that Shijiao's 
      eye trouble was not serious and there was no need for him to stay in 
      hospital. So I immediately went to fetch him out. We were about to leave 
      the hospital when a nurse hurried over to me.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you the interpreter?&quot; she asked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes , &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Could you please help us. The Indian patient you 
      brought in vvith you yesterday, you know, we can't communicate with him. 
      Nobody in the hospital speaks English. &quot;<br>
      &quot;All right. Let's see if I can be of help. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shijiao and I followed her to the Sikh's ward. Three 
      doctors and nurses were around his bed, trying to get through to him with 
      gestures and a few English words. They were very relieved to see me.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked the Indian. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he replied in a language I had never heard before.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;English! English! Don't you speak English?&quot; 
      I asked.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed he knew the word 'English' , for he shook his 
      head. I didn't kriow what to do now. It was beyond me.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Shijiao started speaking in a strange language. It 
      was so funny. How come? The native tongue in The Maldives is Devehi, 
      certainly not a language in India. Shijiao turned to me and said. &quot;My 
      parents came from India. I speak a little Hindi. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was great. The examination started. The doctors 
      told me in Chinese<br>
      what they wanted to know. I translated it into English. Shijiao told the 
      patient in Hindi. The Sikh answered in Hindi: Shijiao told me in English, 
      and I put it into Chinese for the doctors.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The examination took a full hour. The doctors and the 
      patient were very happy, for at last they could communicate with each 
      other. When all the questioning was over, the doctor who seemed to be in 
      charge took my hand and Shijiao's hand and said in Chinese. &quot;Thank 
      you very much. &quot; Then the patient smiled at me and said, &quot;Tan 
      Kiu. &quot; (Thank you)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was such an exciting and stimulating experience. I 
      felt how good it was to be an interpreter.<br>
