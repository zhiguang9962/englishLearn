      Never Give up the Hope of Living<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this recorded conversation with a friend, Alison 
      Willson described her reactions to the news that she was going to die of 
      cancer. The conversation took place five months before her death.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I told myself, &quot;The thing has happened. 
      However much you fuss , and scream , and yell , it's not going to change 
      &quot; I realised I'd got to discipline myself. Another thing was, I 
      remembered the vicar of a church I used to go to saying that this kind of 
      thing was often much harder for the relatives than for the patient. So 
      here there was scope for me to do something positive.</font>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, just before I left the hospital, I came across 
      two young women in their thirties, both with small children and both with 
      cancer. I thought , well , what am I worrying about , because my children 
      are grown up and independent. If I can get this right for myself and make 
      some sort of peace with it , then the people who love me will also accept 
      it and this needn't be too 6ad a time.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it wasn't as simple as that. When I came out 
      of hospital I found I was getting it wrong with quite a lot of people , 
      because they didn't look at it the same way as I did. And again, I think 
      if you're going to die around the age of 50, far more people are involved 
      than if you're dying when you're really old. You know, it's fairly 
      threatening to people of your own age, they see you in the middle of a 
      fairly busy life suddenly stopping-and they find it unacceptable. This 
      busincss again of getting them to givc me pcrmission to die. . .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several of me friends still feel very angry and bitter 
      aboui it and just won't accept it. In consequence they tell me I shouldn't 
      accept it. I get all these stories about these heroic people who have 
      organ after organ rcmoved and say, I'm not going to die; I'm going to 
      live; and they go on, year after year. It makes me fecl I'm be.ing 
      terribly fecble. I feel rather guilty , as if what they're saying is , 
      wcll . you're not trying hard enough.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't really see what else I could be doing. I'm very 
      confused about all this. I don't quite understand what I ought to do. Well 
      , I suppose one could be a Chichester and rush across the Atl.antic in a 
      boat. But you know. really , I'm too tired for that. I think what I want 
      to say to people is that if you're in this situation it isn't nearly as 
      bad as people who try and put themselves in your position think it is.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one thing . other people comc to it cold , whereas 
      I've been doingAmy homework on it for the last two years. I've got used to 
      the idea and have come to the point of acceptance gradually. The other 
      thing is that they're feeling well and vigorous, with lots of things 
      they're in the middle of doing. But I am actually getting very tired and 
      don't fecl vcry well.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that I can't drive my car and am generally 
      having to cut down my activitics isn't as&nbsp;&nbsp; bad for me as 
      they?think it is. I try to get this through to people, and it seems to 
      release their anxiety a bit. My friends are beginning to accept what is 
      happening and come along with me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been a time for thinking about relationships and' 
      sorting out those which weren't very satisfactory. Also, to a large 
      extent, the pressure is off and you're going to die, you don't really have 
      to do much. It's rather a rclief if you're not feeling well. I've been 
      very happy these last six months.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to think that if you knew you were dying there 
      would be a great black pall over everything, and nothing could be of any 
      value. But it isn't like that. In some ways, even, you get increased 
      appreciation of things. Colours are brighter and littlc pleasures mean 
      more. You almost get another dimension.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that if. I hadn't understood what was happening, 
      and come to terms with it , this would have been lost. So if you asked me 
      whether I would rather have a coronary or what I've got . I would rather 
      have this because I've had all this good time. And I feel sad because 
      other people might have it , but miss it -because they aren't allowed to 
      come to terms with what's going to happen, or don't feel able to, and this 
      is such a waste.<br>
      <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang Jinghui is a lecturer in China Textile University 
      in Shanghai. Now, at the age of fifty-three, he is about to leave this 
      world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July last year, he was diagnosed as to be suffering 
      from cancer in the esophagus. The doctor told him that there might still 
      be a slight chance for him if he got operated on at once, as the cancer 
      was already in an advanced stage. The news greatly alarmed Wang and his 
      daughter who had accompanied him to the hospital. Naturally they wanted to 
      have an operation at once as there was not a moment to be lost.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But all our wards are full at the moment,&quot; 
      the doctor told them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How long do we have to wait then?&quot; the 
      daughter asked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At least two months. We have a long waiting list. 
      &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back at home, the daughter was at her wit's end. Five 
      years earlier, her mother had died of cancer. It was her father then who 
      had looked after everything - her mother's operation, then the funeral. 
      And after her mother's death, it was her father who looked after her and 
      her younger sister, and had seen them through school, and then college for 
      her. She had just graduated and her younger sister was still at school. 
      How could they do without their father? No, their father must not die.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lost no time and spared no efforts in finding a 
      hospital for her father. She went everywhere and asked everybody friends , 
      relatives , acquaintances , anyone who might know of a way to , or have 
      connections with a hospital. A few days later one of her former 
      schoolmates came with the heartening news that one of her friends had a 
      relative who could pull strings with a certain big hopital.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so this friend's friend's relative made his 
      appearance. He proved to be very helpful and enthusiastic, and promised to 
      see the whole thing through. But he constantly dropped hints to Wang's 
      daughter about the &quot;going price&quot; for&quot;road-paving&quot; to a 
      hospital.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hospital things went as smoothly as he had 
      promised. Wang's daughter had handed him three hundred yuan, and soon he 
      had everything arranged - consultation for Wang and registration for 
      living in. He informed them that there would be a vacant bed the following 
      Monday.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went home full of hope. He, the man who had 
      arranged everything for them, began to lay down his cards. &quot;The going 
      price is two thousand and five hundred yuan. But don't worry,&quot; he 
      hastened to add when he saw the alarm in father and daughter's faces. 
      &quot;I've managed to bring it ddwn to the bottom line-- one thousand two 
      hundred. But you have to get it ready soon. I have to satisfy the 
      registration office, the surgeon-in-charge, the operating doctor and his 
      assistant, the two anaes thetists- not a single one could be left out. 
      &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else could they do? In order to cure her father, 
      the daughter went about and managed to scrape together 500 yuan which she 
      handed to the man just before her father went to live<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As arranged Wang entered the hospital on Monday, July 
      16. But more than a week went by and nobody seemed to bother about him, 
      and nothing was 'mentioned about his operation. Both father and daughter 
      were worried about this endless waiting and she approached the man again, 
      to see if he could speed things up. &quot;An operating doctor has yet to 
      be found. &quot; She understood what that meant , and as she was almost 
      worried to death, she gritted her teeth and produced another four hundred 
      yuan. Apparently the man meant what he said when he mentioned one thousand 
      two hundred as the bottom line.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 28, Wang finally was wheeled into the operation 
      theatre. But he was not kept there for long. The doctor opened up his 
      chest and found that cancer had reached such a stage as to make an 
      operation impossible. So merciless was the hand of fate!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a reporter from Xinmin Evening went to see Wang 
      early this year, she found an emaciated man lying in bed, obviously 
      nearing his last. He could hardly produce a coherent sentence, but he kept 
      repeating ; &quot;We've been robbed of one thousand two hundred yuan . .. 
      Now we are penniless . . . what is going to happen to my two girls?. . . 
      &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter said: &quot;What happened to us was far 
      from unique. It has become quite a common practice for patients to pay 
      through their noses in order to live in. All the same I want our story to 
      be told, not that I have any illusions about getting our money back&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additional Information<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago , an unusual wedding was held in Bcijing's 
      Yuyuantan Park. Both the bride and bridegroom suffered from cancer but had 
      made surprising improvement with the aid of qigong. a traditional C.hinese 
      healing system that relies heavily on breathing exercises. It is also 
      through qigong that the young couple met and fell in love.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 28-year-old Guo Chengpei was formerly a top player 
      on the Beijing table tennis team. But after participating in the First 
      Pyongyang lnternational Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in Sepember 
      1981 , he felt his health declining and he could hardly talk. After an 
      examination he was diagnosed as having lung cancer, which is usually 
      fatal. He had to stop training and undergo treatment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Guo's cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, it 
      was inoperable. The radiation treatment he received helped little. His 
      doctor predicted that despite his youth, Guo had only three months to 
      live.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, being trained as a table tennis player for 12 
      years, he had an unyielding will and an optimistic attitude. and he did 
      not give up hope.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his friends suggested that he practise qigong, 
      which is credited with prolonging many cancer patients' lives. This 
      strengthened his will to surmount the disease.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took his friend's advice to practise Guo Lin qigong 
      (a combination of moving and breathing) every day.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting up at 2:45 a. m. he took the night shuttle bus 
      to Ditan Park and started his routine at 3:40 a. m. He practised for more 
      than five hours. His father and uncles took turns accompanying him.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his strong will and indomitable perseverance, he 
      has kept practising qigong for seven and a half years, in all kinds of 
      weather.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A check-up in 1987 showed that the lung cancer's spread 
      to the lymph nodes had disappeared and the tumour was reduced in size. His 
      weight has increased from 60 to 85 kilograms. He has become fitter and his 
      general health has improved.His 26-year-old bride, Chen Yamei, became ill 
      with thymoma in September 1985.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When I was told that I had cancer, I felt the 
      future looked so dark and miserable that I was in despair,&quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December that year, she had an operation. Afterwards 
      she received chemical and radioactive treatments, but little effect could 
      be seen. The cancer began to spread to the lymph nodes and bones.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was hospitalized she often saw patients 
      around her die. She was terribly frightened and she felt on the brink of 
      death herself.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 1986, she heard that qigong could help cure 
      cancer. Though she didn't completely believe it, she saw a glimmer of hope 
      and decided to try It.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also went to Ditan Park to learn qigong and was 
      assigned to the class that was instructed by Guo Chengpei.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everyone in my qigong class looks vigorous and 
      energetic,&quot;Chen said. &quot;There is no sign that they have had the 
      deadly disease. It gives me confidence<br>
      and courage to live on. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She often sought advice from Guo and he always helped 
      her patiently and enthusiastically. They shared experiences and encouraged 
      each other. At last love blossomed in the young couple's hearts.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three years of constant qigong practice, Chen's 
      condition is stable. Now she says she has a better appetite and sleeps 
      more soundly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Curing cancer through qigong had a scientific 
      basis,&quot; Guo said. &quot;The growth of cancer cells is restrained when 
      one breathes plenty of oxygen. After one properly practises qigong for 
      quite a long time, he is able to greatly enlarge his respiratory capacity. 
      This is good for cancer patients. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing on his own experience, Guo thinks that 
      combinations of qigong, Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine 
      are the best way to conquer cancer. And he said a wholesome psychological 
      outlook is the most important thing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everyone suffering from cancer should think like 
      this; Even if the survival<br>
      rate in cancer is only 0. 1 per cent , I am the 0. 1 per cent , &quot; Guo 
      said. &quot;Those who can get better the fastest are those who are strong 
      in spirit. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple hope that all cancer patients love life and 
      never lose their hope of living.<br>
