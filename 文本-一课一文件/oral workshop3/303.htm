      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Brain Drain<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that Shanghai's musicians abroad could form 
      a worldclass symphony orchestra.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra once failed to find 
      a qualified conductor for a whole year!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar situation exists in science, medicine and 
      sports circles.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stopping the outflow of talent depends on creating a 
      sound domestic environment rather than simply setting up barriers for 
      those who wish to go abroad.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A handful of people go abroad to seek a comfortable 
      life. But most Chinese intellectuals emigrate because they cannot bring 
      their talent into full play in their motherland.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many conductors trairied by the Shanghai Conservatory 
      of Music have gone abroad either because they cannot find jobs in symphony 
      orchestras due to the competition for places, or because they cannot 
      develop themselves in orchestras where promotion comes only by way of 
      seniority.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We face a keen shortage of talent, but one batch of 
      gifted people after another have gone abroad&quot;. The situation is grim.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to improve the conditions for all 
      intellectuals by a wide margin. But it is possible for governments. at all 
      levels to create a better environment for their development.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outflow of talent is a loss to our nation as well 
      as a pressuse forcing us to optimize the environment for the taleated.<br>

      II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      l. Give Students More I.eeway<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years ago, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau 
      issued four passports each day. Now the staff must work long hours to 
      process more than 1, 000 a day.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People's Daily reports that more than 70,000 Chinese 
      students and scholars are now studying abroad with still more ready to go.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While many people are worried about the brain drain 
      problem, the article said that whatever the motives of students who leave, 
      there is no doubt that they cherish a deep feeling towards the motherland.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been suggested that people who fail to returnon 
      time should be granted &quot;temporary leave from their posts&quot; to 
      encourage them to return at any time.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among those who joined the recent rush abroad, more 
      than half went to further their studies and keep up with the latest 
      academic achievements. According to a survey conducted among some 7, 000 
      scientific researchers in Shanghai, 82 per cent believed that their 
      experiences abroad were &quot;fruitful&quot;. Half said they had made 
      headwayin their work.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, they said they continued to follow with 
      great concern the development of their country's economic reforms. 
      Ascholar with a doctorate from 1 Iew York University had written over 100, 
      000 words of suggestions to the Chinese central government, the article 
      reported.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loneliness was found to be the worst enemy of 
      thestudents living away from their families and homeland.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brain drain from developing to developed countries 
      is an international<br>
      phenomenon. In China, backward management and unreasonable distribution 
      systems, together with poor living and working conditions, have led to the 
      departure of many intellectuals.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;After my graduation from university, I have spent 
      four years in my office reading a newspaper with a cup of tea every day I 
      want to go abroad to start a new life, &quot; said a 25-year-old technical 
      worker who was waiting for a visa from the Japanese Consulate.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students and scholars had stayed in foreign 
      countries beyond their time limit for one reason or another. For this thoy 
      had been labelled unpatriotic.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But People's Daily called for more trust and 
      understanding of those students.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A scholar studying and working at an American 
      university said he would return to China as soon as his daughter finished 
      secondary school in the US.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A young scholar at a Shanghai research institute said 
      he could not manage to conduct research with a meagre State allocation of 
      2, 000 yuan a year. In America, he can get $ 24, 000 a yeat' for use in 
      research, so he decided to stay on after getting his degree.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such cases, most work units back in China dismiss 
      those who fail to return on time. This hurts the feelings of many who are 
      willing to return later, the article said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, those who do return face a job 
      problem.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China,s irrational employment and personnel system 
      prevents some from fully using the skills and knowledge they have acquired 
      abroad.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Xiaobai, with a PhD in Physics, wrote to il 
      institutions of higher learning in China. Two of them refused him and the 
      others did not even answer him. Just before deciding to go back to 
      America, he was hired by a Chinese research institute which knew of him.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Personal Progress and Job-hopping<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many parts of the world, personal influence is 
      almost essential in getting ahead. One needs a &quot;godfather? a 
      &quot;sponsor&quot;. Here that is not true. Naturally all people use 
      influence sometimes, but one rarely advances far on that basis alone in 
      the United States. Here traits which lead to success are generally 
      considered to be the willingness to work hard (at any kind of job), 
      scholarship or skill, initiative, an agreeable and outgoing personality. 
      In other words even in the realm of personal progress, this is a 
      &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; society. By and large, success is neither<br>
      inherited nor bestowed. This means, therefore, that our employment 
      practices are different from those in many other countries.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some nations it is considered disloyal to quit a 
      job; deep reciprocal loyalties exist between employee and employer 
      (recipient and &quot;patron?in many cases); lifelong job security and 
      family honor are frequently involved.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not.true in the United States. 
      &quot;Job-hopping&quot; is part of our constant mobility. We consider it a 
      &quot; right &quot; to be able to better ourselves, to move upward, to 
      jump from company to company if we can keep qualifying for more 
      responsible (and therefore better) jobs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This interchangeability of personnel seems unreasonable 
      to some members of foreign nations. Where are our roots? How can we be so 
      cold and inhuman? &quot;We act,?some say, as if we were dealing with 
      machines, not humans. ?They do not understand that a great many Americans 
      like to move about. New jobs present new challenges, new opportunities, 
      new friends, new experiences-often a new part of the country.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The employer may be quite content too. Perhaps he has 
      had the best of that man's thinking; a new person may bring in fresh 
      ideas, improved skills, or new abilities. Then, too, a newcomer will 
      probably start at a lower salary for he will have no seniority. Hopping is 
      so readily accepted here, in fact, that a good man may bounce back and 
      forth among two or three corporations, being welcomed back to his original 
      company more than once through his career, each time at a different level.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <a name="3.">3. </a>Residents Go Overseas to Seek Their Fortunes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanghai has become a favourite investment spot with 
      foreigners eager<br>
      to get a financial foothold in China.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the development of its export-oriented 
      economy, the city looks set to become an international trade and financial 
      centre on the west bank of the Pacific Ocean.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But many Shanghai people are not content simply to sit 
      and wait for the foreigners to come to them-they want to go abroad 
      themselves to try their luck.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shanghainese have a reputation for being able to 
      find work the world over. Before the founding of New China in 1949, 
      hundreds of thousands of them were trading throughout the world.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1950s and 1960s when the country was pursuing 
      its closeddoor policy, hundreds of factories, research institutes and 
      universities--involving more than 1 million people-were moved from 
      Shanghai into the inland areas to support the nation's socialist 
      construction. Now,people with Shanghai accents can be found all over the 
      country.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current policy of developing the export-oriented 
      economy in the coastal areas has stimulated the Shanghai people's desire 
      to head off for foreign parts.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, according to the Shanghai-based Jiefang Daily, the 
      best way for them to do this is to engage in business or provide labour 
      and technical services to other countries.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanghai has too many people chasing too few jobs, so 
      this surplus labour force could solve the labour shortages which exist in 
      some other parts of the world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers' monthly wages abroad can be 100 times what 
      they are in China-although the cost of Iiving is likely to be much higher 
      in some countrtes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, while working overseas, the Chinese 
      workers would get the chance to learn advanced technology and to become 
      entrepreneurs and specialists, thus promoting trade and economic 
      co-operation between China and other countries.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jiefang Daily suggests locai authorities should take 
      the following measures to promote exports of labour:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set up labour service groups to undertake contractual 
      projects abroad. Shanghai workers have taken part in many overseas 
      projects in the past, such as construction of railways, factories and 
      other buildings. With their high reputation, they would be a force to be 
      reckoned with on the world labour market.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estahlish&nbsp; employer-employee&nbsp; introduction&nbsp; 
      offices. &nbsp; Drivers,&nbsp; repairmen, nurses,&nbsp; housemaids,&nbsp; 
      hairdressers,&nbsp; cooks and workers involved in gardening and 
      construction are in great demand in many countries and these offices could 
      provide training and act as a bridge between employers and employees.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage peopie to look for jobs themselves. As many 
      Shanghai residents have relatives overseas, they could easily get help in 
      finding work abroad.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promote co-operation between the State and individuals. 
      If local people are encouraged to work abroad, workers with special skills 
      would flow out of the country, thus creating a brain drain. To solve the 
      problem, consideration must be given to both State and private interests. 
      When workers go abroad at their own expense, the enterprises they work for 
      should give them favourable treatment when they return. While working 
      overseas, the workers should help their enterprises open up to the world 
      market.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanghai residents have strong aspirations to expand 
      their living space and they are good at trading. But first priority should 
      be given to entrepreneurs who are brave enough to journey out into the 
      world and build success.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the founding of new China, a number of 
      world-renowned figures such as shipping magnate Pao Yue Kang and the 
      computer king Wang An were raised in Shanghai. It is expected that a group 
      of new magnates will emerge when Shanghai entrepreneurs enter the world 
      economy.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Shanghai is capable of building 100, 
      000-ton-class vessels and manufacturing sophisticated precision building 
      machines, powerful generators, colour televisions and bicycles, there is 
      no reason why the city could not create a group of world-class shipping 
      kings, building machine kings and bicycle kings.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a solid industrial foundation and technical force, 
      Shanghai could also set up factories and shops overseas to compete with 
      foreign counterparts. Shanghai-made brands, very popular at home now, will 
      surely capture a slice of the world market if sales promotion is 
      emphasized.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanghai produces quality cloth shoes of good 
      workmanship. But its exports are $ 1. 1 billion annually, only half of 
      Taiwan's total, due to the neglect of sales promotion overseas.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanghai boasts numerous specialists in the fields of 
      science, technology,culture and education. These experts could earn a good 
      deal of foreign exchange for the State if technical services were offered 
      to countries that badly need skilled workers in high-tech industries.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city can also directly export technology and 
      software and contract scientific research projects abroad, as it possesses 
      advantages in the fields of laser, optical fibre, microelectronics and 
      biological engineering technology.<br>
