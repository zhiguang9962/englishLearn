      Does Criticism Do More Harm Than Good to People?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      A Yoang Woman Who Fears Compliments<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marya, a brilliant graduate student in her early 
      twenties who came for consultation, insisted that she could improve only 
      with criticism. Her reasoning was that she knew the good qualities but 
      that she did not know the bad ones. To have more knowledge of her negative 
      qualities, she believed,would add to her self-understanding and thus 
      enable her to see herself more completely. Marya, in effect, refused to 
      acknowledge and to understand her strengths. She had assembled detailed 
      lists of her negative qualities which she used daily to support an 
      extremely negative view of herself . But they were either exaggerated or 
      unreal.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite her attractiveness to others, she convinced 
      herself that she was ugly. When her family bought her new and 
      well-designed articles of clothing (she seldom. bought any herself ), she 
      left them hanging in the closet for weeks before wearing them once. When 
      someone complimented her on what she wore and asked whether it was new, 
      she could honestly answer no. She did not &quot;deserve&quot; to wear new 
      clothes. She could not bear the pain of hearing compliments, of seeing 
      herself as intelIigent, pretty, or worthwhile.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, Marya had received little or no criticism 
      from her parents. She was prized by them. Their major disappointment in 
      her apparently was that she often rejected their overtures of kindness and 
      appreciation, not in anger but in embarrassment, as though she were 
      undeserving. This seemingly mild-mannered young woman, exceptionally 
      courteous and considerate to others, held onto her own negative 
      selfjudgment with tenacity. Finally, friends and interested faculty 
      members quit acceding to her persuasive requests for criticism that they 
      could not honestly give. Instead, they gently but firmly confronted her 
      with her own blindness to what she truly was like.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>

      l. Unfair Criticism<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart is a typical sixteen-year-old boy who 
      experienced and suffered from the criticism of an alcoholic parent. It 
      seemed to 5tuart the only thing his father ever had to say to him was, 
      &quot;You haven't got a brain in your head. ?Stuart was a sophomore in 
      high school. It was true he was a poor student, or what his dean called an 
      &quot;underachiever&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Even though 
      Stuart knew he was an underachiever, he would have liked to hear his 
      father say, just once, something else when he brought home his report card 
      other than his usual, &quot;You haven't got a brain in your head.&quot;<br>
      Stuart was determined to prove to his father he did have a brain in his 
      head. Stuart studied very hard. Some nights it was difficult for him to 
      concentrate on his homework because he could hear his parents bickering in 
      the next room.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You forgot to pay the mortgage again. The bank is 
      fed up.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How many times can a person smash up a car? I , m 
      sucprised they haven't taken your license away! &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If you wouldn't drink so much . . . &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart didn't like the bickering, and wondered if his 
      parents might separate. He wondered, too, because his father was so 
      forgetful about paying the bills, if they might lose their home.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept telling himself that if he studied hard, maybe, 
      by some miracle, things would get better at home.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart's determination to concentrate on his school 
      work, in spite of the bickering and worries at home, paid off. His next 
      report card showed a marked improvement. There was even a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      personal note of praise from his dean written on the report card.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proudly Stuart put the report card on his father's 
      desk. Stuart felt happier than he had felt in a long time. He knew that 
      his father could only be pleased with such a report, but more important, 
      maybe now his father would realize that he was intelligent and would start 
      paying some attention to him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Stuart 
      could remember when his father used to go to ballgames and movies with 
      him. Who knew? Maybe things would go back to the way they used to be. 
      Stuart would offer to get a part-time job to help pay off some of the 
      bills. He thought that might lessen some of the arguing at home and keep 
      the family from breaking up. He would lat his father know that he was old 
      enough to understand things weren't always easy at the office.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Stuart's father came home and saw the report, he 
      said without any hesitation, &quot;Well, well, who did the work for you? I 
      know you don't have the brains to do it! &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart was stunned. All that work for nothing! He 
      wouldn't be surprised if his father not only thought he was stupid but 
      hated him, too.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart would not have been as hurt if he had only known 
      his father was tied up in his own miserable feelings. This kept him from 
      recognizing what Stuart had accomplished in school.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Uses of Criticism<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While some of us have a tendency to disbelieve or to 
      minimize the good things people say about us, others among us have a 
      tendency to hold a protective web around ourselves in defense against 
      criticism. One workshop participant said, &quot;I confuse the issue by 
      getting logical in the face of threatening reactions. Sometimes I act 
      helpless so others will stop the criticism. ?Early in the workshop 
      experience he had received more negative than positive reactions. While he 
      was fearful of criticism, he found that he had courted it, hoping that he 
      could learn how to handle it and overcome his fear.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may court negative reactions for other reasons. A 
      therapy group member regarded criticism as more useful than compliments, 
      and criticism is what he often got-not because he asked for it directly, 
      but because of his detached manner, as though he were sitting in judgment 
      of others. Moreover, his tendency to qualify and hedge his opinions and 
      feelings until they had no meaning often brought down the ire of others 
      upon him. He gave the impression of accepting their displeasure stoically, 
      as though it strengthened him. He never openly criticized other members, 
      however.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still another member, who claimed that&quot;criticism 
      is the stuff that we grow on? gave others criticism galore so they could 
      improve and, in his words, &quot;not appear in a negative light in the 
      future.&quot; This member came across as using his ostensible concern for 
      the growth of others as an excuse to criticize and attack them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Is It Right to Withhold One's Reactions to Others?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not uncommon for us to withhold our reactions to 
      others. We may hold back compliments for fear of embarrassment to them and 
      to ourselves. We may hold back criticism for fear of being disliked or 
      considered unfair, or for fear of hurting another person. Reactions given 
      inconsiderately may indeed hurt others. On the other hand, some of us are 
      inclined to withhold our reactions from others while at the same time we 
      honestly prefer that they not hold back theirs from us. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">We may have two 
      different rules. The first one may be: If we ask others for candid 
      reactions to our behavior, to something we have done or plan to do, we 
      want them to tell us straight, including the negative with the positive. 
      The second rule may be: If someone else asks us for similar reactions, we 
      are inclined to hold back or gloss over the negative and embroider the 
      positive.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Criticism Is a Kind of Demand on Those Criticized<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As children, many of us got a great deal of criticism 
      and, as a result, learned a variety of patterns for coping with it. Marya 
      had apparently received little criticism, but, knowing that she was not 
      perfect and deserved what other children got, developed her own patterns 
      of selfjudgment and censure. Being judged, whether we are underestimated 
      or overestimated, usually implies a demand, subtle or direct, that we 
      change. If others do not demand change, we may feel the need to demand it 
      of ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reactions that are relatively free from attempts 
      to change or discredit us, given by someone who cares for us, and with the 
      intention of letting us know what impressions we are making, may be easier 
      to take. If, however, our usual reaction is to defend ourselves, even mild 
      criticism or impressions given gently without demands that we change may 
      play havoc with our defensive structure and beccnne difficult to handle.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. How to Handle Criticism<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surgeon reached over and jerked the syringe out of 
      the nurse,s hand. &quot;Jane, that's the sloppiest injection I've ever 
      seen!&quot; he snapped. Quickly, his fingers found the vein she had been 
      searching for. Cheeks burning, Jane turned away. ~Ten years later, Jane's 
      voice still trembles when she relates the experience.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our male co-workers have it easier. They grew 
      up encouraged<br>
      to play team sports, and they had to handle a coach's yells when they 
      droppped the ball. Now they can see that a goof on the job is like 
      dropping the ball in football; the fumble is embarrassing, but you take it 
      in stride and go on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for most women, the path to success was different. 
      As girls, we grew up wanting to be popular; we were praised for what we 
      were, not for what we did. So our reaction to criticism is often, 
      &quot;Someone doesn't like me. I failed to please. I'm a failure.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I get defensive,&quot; says Rhonda, a teacher, 
      &quot;When someone criticizes me, suddenly I'm a little girl again, being 
      scolded, and I want to make excuses. I want to explain that it's not my 
      fault-it's someone else's, or I want to hide and cry.&quot;<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      6. Take a Tactful Approach<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about giving criticism? The old 
      &quot;I-want-to-be-liked&quot; syndrome can make it as hard to give 
      criticism as to take it. Karen thinks she's found the answer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Two weeks after I was promoted to first-line 
      supervisor,&quot; she remembers, &quot;I had to tell a friend that she was 
      in trouble for not turning in her weekly reports on time. My boss 
      suggested that I tell Judy I didn't want to fix the blame-I just wanted to 
      fix the problem. That was wonderful advice. It allowed me to state the 
      problem objectively to Judy and she olfered the solution.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criticism in the workplace, whether you're giving it or 
      getting it, is always more effective when you focus on the task rather 
      than on the person. Fixing the problem, not thc?blame, means that nobody 
      has to feel chewed out or chewed up. We can still feel whole and learn 
      something in the process.<br>
