      Is It Good for Students to Have Part-time Jobs?<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      School Part-timers<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More and more high school students in Beijing are 
      turning their minds to ways of making money.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are capitalizing on opportunities such as one 
      group of students who went to the front gate of the Children's Centre in 
      the East District of Beijing when a film studio was there conducting 
      auditions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group sold the young hopefuls application forms at 
      five fen a piece after getting the forms from the centre for free.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young entrepreneurs are also capitalizing on high 
      demand eommodities not always available away from the big shopping centres. 
      Birthday or greeting cards are an example. One department store estimated 
      that 80 per cent of its sales of cards are to students for resale.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiao Li, a junior high school student at Fengtai 
      District in the southwest region of the capital, spent 40 yuan buying 
      cards from downtown shops just before the last Spring Festival.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sold them at her school and schools nearby at 
      prices 15 to 20 per cent higher than what she had paid. In a month, she 
      earned 100 yuan, representing a 250 per cent return on her initial 
      investment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A senior high school student who had been selling cards 
      has now become an amateur wholesale dealer. His wholesale price is 8 per 
      cent higher than his purchasing price and 10 per cent lower than the 
      retail price. Within two months, he had earned several hundred yuan in 
      profits.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many students have merged their activities to avoid 
      price wars. For example, in an area with few State-owned shops and far 
      from the city centre, student union heads from the schools there have 
      reached an agreement on card prices. The agreement says prices may be 
      higher than at the downtown shops but lower than at the peddlers' stalls.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Card-selling is just a beginning. Some students turn 
      their eyes to other more profitable ventures.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take one senior high school sophomore who has developed 
      a flourishing business selling photos of famous people. He even has his 
      own name card that reads: The High School Student Corporation Ltd of 
      Exploitation of New Technology.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The student carries a portfolio of the photos around 
      with him in. an atbum to show his young customers. He offers a wide 
      variety of photos, from American movie star Sylvester Stallone in Rambo 
      pose to Taiwan's famous singer Qi Qin.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;These all depend on my high quality camera, 
      &quot; he boasts and explains how he clipped the pictures from magazines, 
      photographed them and then developed the prints into various sizes. He has 
      sold hundreds.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another student is now an amateur salesman for a 
      company and earns a three per cent commission on each sale.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he had earned 300 yuan through his own efforts, he 
      said, &quot;I feel that I have really become an adult.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the money the students earn is spent on 
      theraselves. They can buy high-priced items like a pair of running shoes 
      which can cost as much as 100 yuan-a month' s salary for an average 
      worker. Few parents can afford such luxuries.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students find work to help them realize their 
      dreams of a career.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qian Qian wants to become an actress. In her spare time 
      she attends a class outside school that costs 80 yuan a month in tuition, 
      an amount which her parents cannot afford to pay. So she found a job as a 
      waitress in a coffee house to earn her tuition fee.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students get into business for other reasons 
      besides the money.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zou Yue, a female student, from a fairly wealthy 
      family, took a job because, she said, &quot;Business can cultivate a sense 
      of competition, which is very important for us in the future.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A student who once sold cards said young people are 
      encouraged to be independent.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But how?&quot; he asked. &quot;You can never be 
      independent unless you can support yourself financially.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt after-school work enhanced a young person's 
      social development, too.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical experience in the workforce has been 
      stipulated by the State Commission of Education as a compulsory programme. 
      This is now closely related with economic benefits fits among high school 
      students.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One student, sent by her school to work as a shop 
      assistant at a temple fair, earned five yuan a day for a.seven-hour shift 
      behind the counter.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I had a sore throat after working for a few days, 
      but I had to hold on, &quot; she said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I wanted to earn the-money and also prove that I 
      was an able girl. &quot;<br>
      These temporary job stints give high school students an insight into what 
      work and incomes are all about.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A job at a State-owned cinema may only earn a worker 40 
      or 50 yuan a month. But a job with a self-employed trader, may earn the 
      assistant 8 or 10 yuan a day. A writer may get about 20 yuan for an 
      article in a newspaper or a magazine, but a clothes keeper in a swimming 
      pool may earn at least 200 yuan a month.<br>

      viewpoints while reading.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Jobs Attracting Drop-outs<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At quitting time, a throng of very young workers walked 
      tiredly out of the gate of the Lihua Printworks, a township enterprise in 
      Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Guangdong Province. Fifty per cent were 
      only 13 years old on the average, while the oldest were no more than 17.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teen-agers had to work 14 or 15 hours a day. They 
      started at 7 a. m. every day and had to work until noon. After a one-hour 
      lunch break they worked to 6 p.m. and then had another one-hour rest. Then 
      they went to supper and went back to work again for three or four hours.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although life was very hard, none of them left. They 
      earned 100 yuan a month. &quot;I have much more money than my father, who 
      is a middle school teacher, ?a girl said proudly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Linxia, the capital of Hui Autonomous Prefecture in 
      Gansu Province, dozens of mosques were erected, attracting both tourists 
      and pedlars. At the stands that sold beef, vegetables, fruits and books, 
      children were doing business. The oldest were no more than 16 and the 
      youngest about six. One child weighed a kilogram of apples on his balance 
      scale. When he lifted it, the pan of the balance touched his feet. He 
      staggered among the bustling crowds of tourists crying out for business.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Spring Festival of 1988, more than 1, 000 
      primary and middle school students at Yulin prefecture in Guangxi Zhuang 
      Autonomous Region have left home to work in factories in Shenzhen Special 
      Economic Zone and Dongwan County in Guangdong Province.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve students from the Xingchang Middle School in 
      I.anzhou, Gansu Province, quit school. They left a letter that 
      said:&quot;Dear teacher: We are grown up. Since you taught us to be 
      independent and selfsupporting, we are beginning now.&quot; These 
      children, whose parents are all well educated, were good&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      students in their class.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not far away from Xi' an, an ancient capital in Shaanxi 
      Province, there was a cave dwelling in which more than 30 youths were 
      living. They were all boys between the ages of 11 and 18. &quot;we came 
      out to find a new life,&quot; said one boy. But life was not as beautiful 
      as they had dreamed. They had no job and no money. Eventually, they 
      gathered there.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Guangzhou 77 per cent of the juvenile delinquents 
      under 18 were found to be truants.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China News Service reported that it,s very difficult 
      for well-known professors in the universities in Guangzhou to enroll their 
      students.When a medical college planned to enroll 33 students, only 26 
      people applied .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March, 1988, a post-graduate majoring in mechanical 
      engineering in Shanghai Jiaotong University, who came from a remote rural 
      area, asked for permission to quit school. He said that for the sake of 
      changing his backward hometown, he decided to return and do something for 
      it. But he did not go back home; he became a businessman in Shanghai.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;After three years of study, we will finally get 
      our master's degree and 86.50 yuan as a monthly salary. That can not buy 
      two sweaters. Knowledge is too cheap, &quot;said a graduate student who 
      had quit school.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1988, when the State Commission of Education decided 
      to try a new method of job assignment in some universities, letting the 
      graduates choose their own jobs, and vice-versa, it unexpectedly disrupted 
      the education process itself. Every college student and graduate was busy 
      looking for jobs. They had no time to study.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We have no iron rice bowls. The earlier we find a 
      job the better,&quot; said a student. A wave of quitting school and going 
      into business has swept the campuses of many universities and colleges in 
      China.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the chaotic 10-year-long &quot;cultural 
      revolution'? China had a shortage of 60 million engineers. Now it seems 
      there is a second crisis. Only 11. 8 out of every 10, 000 people are 
      receiving a higher education, 429. 1 studying in high school and 1, 324. 7 
      in primary school. More and more illiterates are living in the society.</font></p>

      2. Those Who Do Not Want to Go to College<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the August lOth issue of The Youth , out 
      of 30, 000 school graduates in Shanghai who could take the college 
      entrance examination this year only 23,000 sat for it. What happened to 
      all the others? Allowing for 2, 000 who were exempted from the examination 
      and went straight to college for their brilliance or for whatever reasons, 
      we still have 5, 000 unaccounted for. In other words, more than 16% of 
      school graduates who got good marks and were qualified to take the 
      entrance examination gave up the chance of going to college. This is 
      certainly a new phenomenon ever since 1977 when competitive entrance 
      examination was restored, but the question is, &quot;Is this going to be a 
      growing tendency?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer this question we have to look into the 
      reasons why the students gave up the examination. Did they give up out of 
      their own free will or were they under some sort of coercion? A simpie 
      clear-cut answer, I am afraid, is impossible to find. Different groups of 
      students give up the examinations for different reasons.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those from the key schools (and they are mestly 
      brilliant students), give up for the simple reason that they want to go 
      abroad. Once they become college students, they are bound by certain 
      regulatiens which make it very difficult,if not impossible, for them to 
      leave the country. Then there are those who think there is not much point 
      in going to college anyway because you can hardly ever get an ideal job 
      after you graduate. The pay is low and more often than not the job is 
      outside your field so you get the frustrated feeling of having wasted four 
      precious years of your life in college. Besides, there is always the 
      danger of your being assigned to a post in another part of the country, so 
      why not be practical and look for a well-paid job straight after middle 
      school?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduates from ordinary middle schools gave up their 
      chances because they lacked self-confidence. &quot;Why try when I stand 
      very little chance?&quot; Not only the poorer students themselves thought 
      this wxy, some teachers even did their best to dissuade them from taking 
      the entrance examination. If they could not increase the number of 
      successful candidates from their school, they could at least decrease the 
      number of unsuccessful candidates by not allowing the poorer students to 
      sit for it. In other words if they could not increase the absolute number 
      they would raise the ratio of successful candidates.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do teachers generally think of this new 
      phenomenon? Some are frankly worried. &quot;Such students lack drive and 
      want to take things easy. This is a reflection of looking down on 
      knowledge, and should be<br>
      taken seriously.&quot; Other teachers think there is'nothing to be alarmed 
      about. &quot;Don't we often tell the students that going to college is not 
      the only road they can take? Society is made up of different strata of 
      useful people. Now that the students have made their own choice in finding 
      their place in society, why make such a fuss about it?&quot;<br>
