      Is Euthanasia Humane?<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Doctor of Good 
      Repntation Hastened His Patient's Death<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most famous mercy killing case in America's history 
      involves Dr. Herman N. Sanders, a country doctor from New Hampshire. In 
      the early 1950s Dr. Sanders had been treating a sixty-year-old woman in 
      Hillsboro County Hospital who was dying of cancer. The woman had wasted 
      away from 140 pounds to 80 pounds. There was no chance for recovery and 
      she suffered extreme pain. Often she screamed out in anguish from her bed. 
      She begged everyone who'came near her to help her die.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toward the end there was little Dr. Sanders could do 
      medically to ease his patient's suffering. He knew that her last,days 
      would be torturously painful. So he decided to put an end to her misery.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Sanders gave his patient four lethal injections of 
      air, which caused her to die painlessly in under ten minutes. He recorded 
      his action on the hospital's record and said no more of the matter.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, hospital administrators came across Dr. 
      Sanders' entry when reviewing the records at a staff meeting and reported 
      it to the state. A warrant for the doctor's arrest was issued and served 
      by the sheriff. The warrant charged that Dr. Sanders &quot;feloniously and 
      willfully and of his own malice and aforethought did inject...air into the 
      veins of Abbie Borroto and with said injection, feloniously and willfully 
      and of his said malice aforethought killed and murdered his patient&quot;. 
      The doctor pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 25, 000 bail .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Sanders had been a known and respected member of 
      his community for many years. He was born in New Hampshire, where his 
      father had been an official of the Public Service Corporation of New 
      Haxripshire. In college, Dr. Sanders had been captain of the Dartmouth ski 
      team as well as a member of the college symphony orchestra. He had 
      recently returned from Europe where he had continued his study of 
      medicine. Until the time of the mercy killing, his reputation was 
      excellent. Dr. Sanders had been considered a trusted and honored 
      physician.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the charges hurled against him, Dr.. 
      Sanders claimed that he had done no wrong. The woman had been within hours 
      of her death. Moved by pity, he had merely hastened an extremely brutal 
      end.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday after his arrest; Dr. Sanders and his family 
      attended services at their church as usual. His minister and other 
      clergymembers across the state openly expressed their support.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One minister in a nearby town preached a stirring 
      sermon in Dr. Sanders' defense. He said that if the doctor was guilty, he 
      was guilty too. For he had often prayed that some suffering parishioner 
      might be &quot;eased into the experience of death&quot; . I.ater that day 
      605 of the 650 registered voters in his town presented Dr. Sanders with a 
      written testimonial to his integrity and goodwill. They told him to use it 
      wherever it might help him to prove his innocence.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, their efforts did little good. The 
      attorney-general<br>
      of New Hampshire firmly stated that &quot;the case will be presented 
      forcefully and in complete detail, regardless of the personalities 
      involved, to the end that justice may be met&quot;. In response, hundreds 
      of Dr. Sanders' fellow townspeople offered<br>
      to testify on his behalf. They signed petitions urging the courts to 
      dismiss the case. Nevertheless, a grand jury indicted him for first-degree 
      murder. &quot;All I can say,&quot; stated Sanders, &quot;is that I am not 
      guilty of any legal or moral wrong and ultimately my position will be 
      vindicated.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long afterward, Dr. Sanders was acquitted. But even 
      after he was declared innocent, some were intent on punishing the doctor. 
      His license to practise medicine was suspended. And while some 
      clergymembers had supported Dr. Sanders, others loudly condemned him from 
      their pulpits. Among them was the Reverend Billy Graham, who stated in 
      Boston that &quot;Dr. Sanders should be punished as an example&quot; and 
      that &quot;anyone who voluntarily, knowingly or premeditatedly takes the 
      life of another, even one minute prior to death, is a killer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Dr. Sanders was not permitted to practise 
      medicine, he supported himself and his family by working as a farm hand. 
      Finally the Medical Board of the State of New Hampshire reinstated his 
      license. And Dr. Sanders has continued as a doctor in his hometown ever 
      since.<br>

      l. Euthanasia: Life or Death Matter<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euthanasia, or mercy killing, is quietly being 
      practised in some urban areas of China despite a lack of legal protection 
      for the death option.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping to hasten the death of terminally ill patients 
      is humane, said Cai Wenmei, an associate professor at the Institute of 
      Population at Beijing<br>
      University.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death should not be viewed.as a failure, but as a 
      normal and natural stage of life, according to Cai. People have the right 
      to die.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death, Cai said, is as natural as birth and, like 
      birth, is sometimes a hard process requiring assistance. It is unnecessary 
      to artificially maintain<br>
      life beyond the point when people can never regain consciousness.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics indicate that medical treatment for a 
      comatose patient costs 26, 000 yuan a year, a heavy burden for the 
      hospital and the patient,s family.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Extending an incurably ill patient's life means 
      the same as aggravating<br>
      his pain,&quot; Cai said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Birth and death are both natural events, but the 
      emotional impact and the personal meanings of these events are vastly 
      different. Birth is usually anticipated with excitement and joy, while the 
      reality of death is often avoided as best one can.<br>
      Views on death are changing in China, where a traditional saying is that 
      debt is better than death, and doctors and nurses do everything they can 
      to save dying patients, including the use of medication and life-support 
      systems.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A survey of 200 old people shows that 92 per cent do 
      not fear death. They do not want a long waiting period. They want to die 
      with dignity and peace, instead of agony and degradation. Euthanasia is a 
      progressive way to die, said a report in Beijing Daily.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy killing can hasten the death of hopelessly ill 
      individuals by withholding life-sustaining procedures so that death will 
      occur naturally and quickly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Cai, euthanasia can end the pain of 
      terminally ill patients and can also be a great relief to their family 
      members, both mentally and physically.<br>
      However, the general adoption of the practice of euthanasia would require 
      changes in ethics and this should happen only after the issue is carefully 
      considered by society.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cai suggests working out laws on euthanasia to protect 
      the practice. Mercy killing, generally induced by an injection of 
      sedatives, should be performed only at the patient's request, with the 
      consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals and family members should respect the dying 
      person's iights in regard to choices about lifestyle, including death.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it would not be right for medical personnel or 
      family members to casually assume that a patient is beyond hope until a 
      thorough<br>
      examination is made of his physical condition and of the effect of further 
      medical treatment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals avoid legal problems by requiring the 
      patient' s family members to request the induced death in writing and by 
      having joint approval of all medical personnei attending the case, 
      including nurses and anesthesiologists.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deng Yingchao, widow of former Premier Zhou Enlai, said 
      that she is very much in favour of mercy killing as a practical concept.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go for 
      euthanasia to be widely accepted because many people still consider it 
      inhumane to perform mercy killing for a patient, no matter how painlessly.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the report in Beijing Daily, time is not 
      yet ripe for drawing up laws for euthanasia because the concept will 
      require complicated changes. Instead, the report advocates,education on 
      death.</font></p>

      2. Mercy or Murder?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 20, 1973, 23 year old Lester M . Zygnamiak 
      walked into his older brother George,s hospital room at Jersey Shore 
      Medical Centre in Neptune, New Jersey, and shot his brother dead.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George had been paralyzed from the neck down in an 
      automobile accident several days earlier. The doctor had told his family 
      that the 26 old boy would probably be paralyzed for life and would never 
      walk again.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Zygnamiaks were an extremely close family. Lester 
      idolized his older brother and would have done anything for him, but now 
      he felt torn. After three intensely emotional days, he decided to obey his 
      brother's wishes. When Lester visited his brother's hospital room, he 
      said, &quot;Iam here today to end your pain. Is that all right with 
      you?&quot; His brother nodded and said yes. Then a shot rang out. Hospital 
      staff rushed to the room, and Lester was soon hauled off to jail.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lester stood trial for his brother' s murder, but was 
      acquitted on November 5, 1973, on the grounds of temporary insanity. The 
      court had determined that he was no longer insane, and Lester was 
      released.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Mrs. 
      Ross Killed Her Daughier Because She Loved Her<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy killing, or euthanasia (from the Greek, eu-meaning 
      good and thanos-meaning death: thus, &quot;a good death&quot;) is against 
      the law. It isb considered a criminal offense. Yet. individuals brought to 
      trial for actual mercy killings are rarely convicted. I.ike I.ester 
      Zygnamiak, they are usually released.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was the case with Anna Marie Ross. At twenty-five 
      Mrs. Ross gave birth to her first child, a baby girl she and her husband 
      named paula. The Rosses had wanted a child for several years, but during 
      her pregnancy Mrs. Ross had unknowingly taken a damaging drug called 
      Thalidomide, which caused Paula to be born severely disfigured. The infant 
      had no arms or legs and her face was badly deformed. Although Paula was of 
      normal intelligence, she was totally deaf and had very poor vision.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paula was expected to live a normal life span. But to 
      survive, she would have to undergo numerous operations. It was expected 
      that she would spend much of her life in hospitals. Anna Ross often stated 
      that she firmly believed her child's normal intelligence would only make 
      her more cruelly aware of her fate. She felt certain the Paula's life 
      would be filled with anguish.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So one night she put Paula to bed and gave her a bottle 
      containing a strong sedative. The baby died painlessly during the night.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna Ross readily admitted to the killing. She said. 
      &quot;I killed little Paula because I loved her. I brought her into the 
      world, and she was unable to end her constant pain and misery. I felt I 
      had to send her to God. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A survey of more than 10,000 people taken by a local 
      newspaper indicated that over 98 percent agreed with Anna Ross's action. 
      Whcn she stood trial, a jury found Mrs. Ross not guilty in under three 
      hours.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Innocent or Guilty?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the majority of persons brought to trial 
      for mercy killing are usually found innocent suggests that the law against 
      it exists only on the books or in theory. But this isn't quite true. Case 
      records indicate that the wheels of justice do not always grind evenly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lester M. Zygnamiak was acquitted, Harold Mohar 
      oi Pennsylvania, involved in a similar case, was not. Mohar was convicted 
      of voluntary manslaughter for killing his blind,cancer-stricken brother 
      who had pleaded with him to do so. He was sentenced to from three to six 
      years in prison and fined $ 500.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of such uncertain consequences, many 
      healthy people have become concerned over their right to die. If stricken 
      with a severe mental or physical disability , they want to be assured that 
      their lives will not be prolonged artificially by medical technology.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="5"> 
      5</a>. Legal System Should Be Established<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      to Deal with Euthanasia<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many countries have legalized mercy killing. In Uruguay 
      the law states that, &quot;The judges are authorized to forgo punishmen,t 
      of a person whose life has been honorable where he commits a homicide 
      motivated by compassion induced by repeated requests by the victim.&quot; 
      Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have adopted similar approaches.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American law appears in need of revision. However, some 
      feel that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse. Any form of murder 
      might be conveniently dubbed&quot; mercy killing &quot; by unscrupulous 
      persons. In response, some euthanasia proponents have suggested that our 
      legal system establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a 
      mercy killing are valid before the act is committed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      6.Is There a Way to Compromise?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical science is doing all it can to extend human 
      life and is succeeding brilliantly. Living conditions are so much better, 
      so many diseases can either be prevented or cured that life expectation 
      has increased enormously. No one would deny that this is a good 
      thing-provided one enjoys perfect health. But is it a good thing to extend 
      human suffering, to prolong life, not in order to give joy and happiness, 
      but to give pain and sorrow? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Take an extreme 
      example. Take the case of a man who is so senile he has lost all his 
      faculties. He is in hospital in an unconscious state with little chance of 
      coming round, but he is kept alive by artificial means for an indefinite 
      period. Everyone, his friends, relatives and even the doctors agree that 
      death will bring release. Indeed, the patient himself would agree-if he 
      were in a position to give choice to his feelings. Yet everything is done 
      to perpetuate what has become a meaningless existence.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of euthanasia raises serious moral issues, 
      since it implies that active measures will be taken to terminate human 
      life. And this is an exceedingly dangerous principle to allow. But might 
      it not be possible to compromise? With regard to senility, it might be 
      preferable to let nature take its course when death will relieve 
      suffering. After all, this would be doing no more than was done in the 
      past, before medical science made it possible to interfere with the course 
      of nature.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are people in Afghanistan and Russia who are 
      reputed to live to a ripe old age. These exceptiona'Ily robust 
      individuals.are just getting into their stride at 70. Cases have been 
      reported of men over 120 getting married and having children. Some of 
      these people are said to be over 150 years old. Under such exceptional 
      conditions, who wouldn't want to go on living dorever? But in our 
      societies, to be ?0 usually means that you are old; to be 90 often 
      means'that you are decrepit. The instinct for selfpreservation is the 
      strongest we possess. We cling dearly to life while we have it and enjoy 
      it. But there always comes a time when we'd be better off dead.<br>
