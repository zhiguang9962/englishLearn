      What Overpopulation Feels Like<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved slowly through the city in a taxi and entered 
      a crowded slum district. The temperature was well over 100°and the air 
      was thick with dust and smoke. The streets seemed alive with people. 
      People eating, people washing, people sleeping. People visiting each 
      other, arguing and screaming. People pushing their hands through the taxi 
      windows, begging. People relieving themselves. </font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">People holding on 
      to the sides of buses. People leading animals. People, people, people, 
      people. As we drove slowly through the crowd, sounding the taxi' s horn, 
      the dust, heat, noise and cooking fires made it like a scene from Hell. 
      Would we ever get to our hotel? All three of us were, I admit, frightened. 
      Since that night, I've known what overpopulation feels like.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics show that rapid population growth creates 
      problems for developing countries. So why don't people have fewer 
      children? Statistics from the developed countries suggest that it is only 
      when people' s living standards begin to rise that birth rates begin to 
      fa11. There are good reasons for this. Poor countries cannot afford social 
      services and old age pensions, and people's incomes are so low they have 
      nothing tospare for savings. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">As a result, 
      people look to their children to provide them with security in their old 
      age. Having a large family can be a form of insurance. And even while they 
      are still quite young, children can do a lot of useful jobs on a small 
      farm . So poor people in a developing country will need to see clear signs 
      of much better conditions ahead before they will think of having smaller 
      families. But their conditions cannot be improved unless there is a 
      reduction in the rate at which population is increasing. This will depend 
      on a very much wider acceptance of family planning and this, in turn,will 
      mean basic changes in attitudes.<br>

      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underlirie the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Childless - and Happy That Way<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a country where most people believe that a family is 
      not a family without children, some young couples, especially those with a 
      higher education, have chosen to keep their families to two members 
      -husband and wife.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can't afford to have a child,&quot; said Wang, 
      a promising research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang has been busy travelling abroad and has received 
      scholarship offers from a number of American universities that would 
      enable him to complete his PhD.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He is a free bird who may leave the nest any day 
      and I've never cared much about a child,&quot; said Xiao Wei, Wang's wife, 
      business representative of a French company in Beijing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the Wangs, Zhang and his wife have argued over 
      whether they should have a baby.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When we were married six years ago, we decided to 
      adopt a waitand-see attitude on the issue. And after a couple of years, my 
      wife said she wanted to have a baby while I insisted we were just fine 
      without one. We have been arguing about the matter ever since, and now 
      that we are over 30, I think we' re likely to end up in accordance with my 
      wishes,&quot; said Zhang.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There are many marriages that should have long 
      been broken. People just hold on because a divorce would hurt the children 
      most and the parents hate to face that prospect. So the couple sticks 
      together and winds up torturing each other.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A real happy family is a family that, without 
      children, is still a happy family, ?said Zhang.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ma Jiang, who has opened a trading company and was 
      instantly nicknamed Money Bags by his friends, said he would hate to be 
      bothered with a child.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To me, being without a child, I am less bound by 
      household chores and can concentrate on my business. My lovely wife is all 
      I need, no third person,&quot; he said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ma' s wife, Xiao Lu, working for a government unit, 
      could have quit her job and become dependent on her &quot;rich&quot; 
      husband. But she decided against it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can' t imagine what I would be like if I stayed 
      at home, doing household chores and breast-feeding a child. I' d rather 
      keep my independence at all costs,&quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whatever people say, I believe that to have a 
      child means a lot of sacrifice. We're just not ready for that, fun or 
      misery,&quot; Ma's wife said. Hou Mingkun and his wife Luo Qian said theyi 
      weren't against having a child, boy or girl, if only the baby was 
      physically well developed. &quot;One takes a risk when having a baby. I've 
      heard too many stories about children born with physical defects. 
      Since-t-here's no guarantee that the same won't happen to my baby, I think 
      I'd better not get myself<br>
      involved. People say `no pain, no gain,' but for me it's no gain, no 
      pain,&quot; Luo said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple were classmates in high school and went to 
      the same university in Shanghai. Now, they are working for a computer 
      company in Beijing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who choose not to have children have to overcome 
      some unexpected &nbsp; difficulties in defending their stance.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Influenced by the traditional view that one's worst sin 
      is having no descendants, most people still accept that a wife is not a 
      good wife if she doesn't have a child.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though few Chinese believe in an after-life, they do 
      care a lot about growing old. For centuries, one of the purposes of having 
      children, sons especially, was to have someone take care of the parents 
      when they were old.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now, since both husband and wife are working, 
      they will have a pension when they retire. What happens now is that the 
      retired parents are supporting their adult children,&quot; Wang said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We're normal people, just like everyone else, 
      We,ve just chosen to live our own way which harms no one. I hope people 
      understand us,&quot; Wang said.<br>
      </font></p>

      2. Three Babies Are Born Every Second</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There are over 3, 800 million people in the world today, and the total is 
      increasing at the rate of .more than 76 million a year. United Nations 
      experts have calculated that it could be more than 7, 000 million by thc 
      end of this century.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The population is growing more quickly in some parts of 
      the world than others. The continents with the fastest growth rates are 
      Latin America (2.9 per cent) and Africa (2.6 per cent). Asia comes third 
      (2.1 per cent) but because its present population is so large it is there 
      that by far the greatest number of people will be added before the end of 
      the century.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. An African Woman Says: 
      &quot;...the Men Never Talk about It.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To us, children are the most important thing in 
      life. When we marry, it is not above all to get a husband or wife, but to 
      have children. I had my thirteenth birth only a few months ago, and most 
      of my adult life I have had to care for a baby as well as do all my other 
      work in the house and in the fields. For a long time I have wanted no more 
      children, but I keep having them as long as I am with my husband. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">A nurse comes to 
      visit our village regularly. She holds meetings for all the men and women 
      together, to explain about family planning. Now these are wellknown facts 
      to us, but still nobody in our village practises birth control. When. we 
      sit together with the nurse, everybody seems to agree that this is the 
      right thing to do when a family had grown big enough to give the parents 
      security in their old age, and there are enough hands to attend to all the 
      daily work. But when we go home, the men never talk about it My husband 
      and I attend every meeting, but in our home we have never talked about 
      birth control. I desperately want to stop having more children, but this 
      can only be done if my husband suggests it.&quot;</font></p>

      &nbsp; 6. It's a World Probl'em<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid rise in world population is not creating 
      problems only for the developing countries. The whole world faces the 
      problem that raw materials are being used up at an increasing rate and 
      food production cannot keep up with the population increase. People in the 
      rich countries rnake the heaviest demands on the world's resources, its 
      food, fuel and land, and cause the most pollution. A baby born in the 
      United States will use in his lifetime 30 times more of the world's 
      resources than a baby born in India. Unless all the countries of the world 
      take united action to deal with the population explosion there will be 
      more and more people fighting for a share of less and less land, food and 
      fuel, and the future will bring poverty, misery and war to us all.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      7. What Has Caused the Population Explosion?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason is not so much a rise in birth rates as 
      a fall in death rates as a <a name="re">re</a>sult of improvements in 
      public health services and medical care. Many more babies now survive 
      infancy, grow up and become parents, and many more adults are living into 
      old age so that populations are being added to at both ends. In Europe and 
      America the death rate began to fall during the Industrial Revolution. In 
      the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America the fall in 
      death rate did not begin till much later and the birth rate has only 
      recently begun to fall.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      8. &quot;The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Babies...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sudden increase in tl~e population of the 
      developing countries has come at a difficult time. Even if their 
      population had not grown so fast they would have been facing a desperate 
      struggle to bring the standard of living of their people up to the point 
      at which there was enough food, housing, education, medical care and 
      employment for everyone to have a reasonable life. The poor countries are 
      having to run faster and faster in their economic activity in order to 
      stay in the same place, and the gap in wealth between rich and poor 
      countries grows wider every year</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most pressing problem created by the rapid increase 
      in population is a shortage of food. More mouths have to be fed every 
      year, and yet a high proportion of the existing population are not getting 
      enough of the right kind of food. Over the past two years the total amount 
      of food has decreased, and of course the total amount of food per person 
      has decreased even more sharply.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More and more of the babies born in developing 
      countries have been surviving infancy and now nearly half the people 
      living in those countries are under the age of 15.The adults have to work 
      harder than ever to provide for the needs of the children, who cannot 
      contribute to the economy until they are older. There is a shortage of 
      schools and teachers, and there are not enough hospitals, doctors and 
      nurses. Farming land is becoming scarce, so country people are moving to 
      the towns and cities in the hope of finding a better standard of living. 
      But the cities have not been able to provide housing, and the newcomers 
      live in crowded slums. Finally, there are too few jobs and unemployment 
      leads to further poverty.<br>
