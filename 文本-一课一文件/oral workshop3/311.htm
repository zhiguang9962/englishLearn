      Who Is to Blame, Mimi, or Her Parents?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always thought Xiao Hong a sl;oilt and wilful child, 
      but today I met a girl a hundred times worse. Compared to her, Xiao Hong 
      is an angel!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle and Aunt Liu came for a visit and brought their 
      darling girl Mimi with them, a girl of five and their only child. The 
      first sight of her disgusted me. She was dressed and made up like nothing 
      on earth. I always hated the sight of Xiao Hong when she got all painted 
      up on C:hildren's Day or on other festive occasions. But this Mimi was 
      painted up for no reasons at all.. </font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">And even worse, 
      she had her hair permed too. It' s bad enough to see grown-up women perm 
      thei.r hair into all sorts of shapes and styles - haysacks, loosewires, 
      bird-nests, cock-tails, name what you will,but it's their own funeral. If 
      they want to abuse and spoil their own hair, they are welcome to it, but 
      to do it to their chilren is really awful. As though that' s not enough, 
      the Lius had Mimi's ears pricked too in order that she may wear ear-rings 
      ... What next? They?woulci have her feet bound too if footbinding should 
      suddenly become fashionable.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="The"> The</a> way she was made up, bad as it 
      was, was nothing compared with the way she behaved. When Mum offered her 
      some sweets, she grabbed two handfuls, and refused to say a &quot;Thank 
      you! &quot; when gently reminded by her mother. &quot;Dear girl! She is 
      always shy before strangers and forgets her manners! &quot; What a 
      bare-faced lie! By no stretch of imagination could Mimi be described as a 
      shy girl . Anyway I don' t think she has had any manners to forget. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">When she played 
      with Xiao Hong's things, her only pleasure seemed to lie in destruction. 
      When she started to tear up Xiao Hong's picture books, it was really too 
      much and Xiao Hong tried to rescue what remained by snatching them away. 
      Obviously Mimi had never been crossed by anyone like this before and she 
      started to howl like a pig being killed. Her parents rushed up to her, as, 
      though their darling daughter was in mortal danger.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Horrid Xiao Hong! Spank her! Spank heri &quot; 
      Mimi kept screaming. Without finding out what it was all about, and 
      without a single word of reprimand, the Lius were all out to mollify her. 
      &quot;There, there, don' t cry my precious! Auntie will spank her later! 
      &quot; But Mimi was not so easily mollified. &quot;No, no! Mammy spank her 
      now!&quot; Her mother really went up to Xiao Hong and clapped her hands 
      behind Xiao Hong's back, pretending to be spanking: &quot;See if you dare 
      to make Mimi cry again! &quot; This sort of farce went on and on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunch was an even more hectic affair, either because 
      she had too much sweets in her or she was over-nourished anyway, she just 
      refused to eat anything. All the same she insisted on having all the best 
      dishes in front of her and dipped her spoon into every one of them at 
      will, while all the time her parents, one on each side of her, tried their 
      best to spoonfeed her. They coaxed and cajoled, and for every occasional 
      mouthful Mimi took, they cheered and praised as though it was a remarkable 
      feat by their darling daughter. They expected cheers and praises from us 
      too. More often than not, Mimi would spit out what she had just taken, and 
      the table was littered with her spilt and spat out food. She spoiled the 
      whole meal for everybody.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last we had a moment of peace and quiet when Mimi 
      dozed off after the meal. But it was only a lull before another storm. 
      When the Lius tried gently to wake her in order to leave, she got into a 
      tantrum because they had disturbed her sleep, and<br>
      she kept raining blows ori her father all the way he carried her 
      downstairs. Serves him damn well right, I said to myself in secret 
      delight. At last Mimi was doing something with my full approval. I would 
      love her even more if she did the same to her mother.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the door finally closed on them, Mum and Dad 
      looked at each other and burst out laughing. Soon we were all laughing.<br>

      l. The Growing up of a Black Boy<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening my mother told me that thereafter I would 
      have to do the shopping for food. She took me to the corner store to show 
      me the way. I was proud. I felt like a grown-up. The next afternoon I 
      looped the basket over my arm arid went down the pavement toward the 
      store. When I reached the corner, a gang of boys grabbed me, knocked me 
      down, snatched the basket, took the money and sent me running home in pamc.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening I told my mother what had happened, but 
      she made no comment. She sat down at once, wrote another note, gave me 
      more money and sent me out to the grocery again. I crept down the street 
      and saw the same gang of boys playing down the street. I ran back into 
      t.he house.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What's the matter?&quot; my mother asked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's those same boys,&quot; I said. &quot;They'll 
      beat me. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You've got to get over that,&quot; she said. 
      &quot;Now, go on.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm scared,&quot; I said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Go on. Anct don't pay any attention to 
      them,&quot; she said;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went out of the door and walked briskly down the 
      sidewalk, praying<br>
      that the gang would not molest me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I came abreast of them, someone shouted, 
      &quot;here he is.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came toward me and I broke into a wild run toward 
      home. Thev overtook me and flung me to the pavement. I yelled, pleaded, 
      kicked, but they rinsed the money out of my hand. They yanked me to my 
      feet, gave me a few slaps and sent me home sobbing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother met me at the door.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They bea... hea... beat me, &quot; I gasped. 
      &quot;They too... too... took the mo... money .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; I 
      stamed up the steps, seeking the shelter of the hcuse.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't you come in here! &quot; my mother warned 
      me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I froze in my tracks and stared at her. &quot;But they 
      are coming after me, &quot; I said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You just stay right where you are,&quot; she said 
      in a deadly tone. &quot;I'm going to teach you this night to stand up and 
      fight for yourself.&quot; She went into the house and I waited, terrified, 
      wondering what she was about.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently she returned with more money and another 
      note. She also had a long heavy stick. &quot;Take this money, this note 
      and this stick,&quot; she said. &quot;(Go to the store and buy those 
      groceries. If those boys bother you, then fight.&quot; I was baffled. My 
      mother was telling me to fight - a thing that she had never done before.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But I'm scared, &quot;I said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't you come into this house until you've 
      gotten those groceries,&quot; she said.<br>
      &quot;'rhey'll beat me.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll beat me,&quot; I said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then stay in the streets. Don't come back 
      here.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran up the steps and tried to force my?way past her 
      into the house. A stinging slap came on my jaw. I stood on the sidewalk, 
      crying. &quot;Please, let me wait until tomorrow!&quot; I begged.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, &quot; she said. &quot;Go now! If you come 
      back into this house without those groceries, I'll whip you. ?She slammed 
      the door and I heard the key turn in the lock.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook with fright. I was alone upon the dark, hostile 
      streets and gangs were after me. I Have the choice of being beaten at home 
      or away from home. I clutched the stick, crying, trying to reason. If I 
      were beaten at home, there was absolutely nothing that I could do about 
      it. But if I were beaten in the streets, I had a chance to fight and 
      defend myself.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked slowly down the sidewalk, coming closer to the 
      gang of boys, holding the stick tightly. I was so full of fear that I 
      could scarely breathe. I was almost upon them now.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There he is again,&quot; the cry went up. They 
      surrounded me quickly and began to grab for my hand.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll kill you.&quot; I threatened.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They closed in and, in blind fear, I let the stick fly, 
      feeling it crack against a boy' s skull. I swung again, landing another 
      skull, then another. Realizing that they would retaliate, if I let up for 
      but a second, I fought to lay them low, to knock them cold, to kill them 
      so that they could not strike back at me. I flayed with tears in my eyes, 
      teeth clenched, stock fear making me throw every ounce of my strength 
      behind each blow. I hit again and again, dropping the money and the 
      grocery list. The boys scattered, yelling, nursing their heads, staring at 
      me in utter disbelief. They had never seen such frenzy. I stood panting, 
      egging them on, taunting them to come on and fight. Wben they refused, I 
      ran after them and t.hey tore out for their homes, screaming.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parents of the boys rushed into the streets and 
      thieatened me. And for the first time in my life, I shouted at grown-ups, 
      telling them that I would give them the same if they bothered me. I 
      finally found my grocery list and the money, and went to the store.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my way back, I kept my stick poised for instant use, 
      but there was not a single boy in sight.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, I won the right to the streets of Memphis.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Parents Are Too 
      Permissive with Their Children Nowadays<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people would defend the Victorian attitude to 
      children, but if you were a parent in those days, at least you knew where 
      you stood: children were to be seen and not heard. Freud and Company did 
      away with all that and parents have been bewildered ever since. The 
      child's happiness is all-important, the psychologists say, but what about' 
      the parents' happiness? Parents suffer constantly from fear and guilt 
      while their children gaily romp about pulling the place apart. A good 
      old-fashioned<br>
      spanking is out of the question: no modern childrearing manual would 
      permit such barbarity. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">The trouble is 
      you are not allowed even to shout. Who knows what deep psychological 
      wounds you might inflict? The poor child may never recover from the 
      dreadful traumatic experience. So it is that parents bend over backwards 
      to avoid giving their children complexes which a hundred years ago hadn't 
      even been heard of. Certainly a child needs love, and a lot of it. But the 
      excessive permissiveness of modern parents is surely doing more harm than 
      good.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychologists have succeeded in undermining parents' 
      confidence in their own authority. And it hasn't taken children long to 
      get wind of the fact. In addition to the great modern classics on child 
      care, there are countless articles in magazines and newspapers. With so 
      much unsolicited advice flying about, mum and dad just don't know what to 
      do ariy more. In the end, they do nothing at all. So, from early 
      childhood, the kids are in charge and parent.s, lives are regulated 
      according to the needs of their offspring. When the little dears develop 
      into teenagers, they take complete control. Lax authority over the years 
      makes adolescent rebellion against parents all the more violent. If the 
      young people are going to have a party, for instance, parents are asked to 
      leave the house. Their presence merely spoils the fun. What else can the 
      poor parents do but obey?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are hardy creatures (far hardier than the 
      psychologists would have us believe) and most of them survive the harmful 
      influence of extreme permissiveness, which is the normal condition in the 
      modern household. But a great many do not. The spread of juvenile 
      delinquency in our own age is largely due to.parental laxity. Mother, 
      believing that little Johnny can look after himself, is not at home when 
      he returns from school, so little Johnny roams the streets. The 
      dividing-line between permissiveness and sheer negligence is very fine 
      indeed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The psychologists have much to answer for. They should 
      keep their mouths shut and let parents get on with the job. And if 
      children are knocked about a little bit in the process, it may not really 
      matter too much. At least this wilt help them to develop vigorous views of 
      their own and give them something positive to react against. Perhaps 
      there's some truth in the idea that children who've had a surfeit of 
      happiness in their childhood emerge like stodgy puddings and fail to make 
      a success of life.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Parental Piety Is Taken to Extremes<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dictionary defines &quot;filial piety&quot; as 
      &quot;a son's or daughter's obedience to and respect for parents&quot;. It 
      is a pity that in reality the implication of this expression has changed 
      in China, a nation so proud of this virtue.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It so happened in a department store that an old 
      couple, after careful<br>
      selection and much hesitation, fumhled 600 yuan from their pockets for a 
      quality down quilt, smiling wi.t.h content when. the package was handed 
      over the counter.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's so good to see the elderly spend their 
      savings for their own sake. There aren't many old people who buy 
      expensi.ve commodities for themselves these days,&quot; commented a. 
      middle-aged paaer-by.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We really should be a bit hedonistic, shouldn't. 
      we?&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old couple's smile froze on hearing the words. 
      &quot;It's actually for my youngest son. He's getting married soon,&quot; 
      sighed the old man.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passer-by nodded understandingly, &quot;Show filial 
      piety to your son, eh?&quot; she said half jokingly. Her words were 
      greeted by a fit of hollow laughter.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This role reversal-piety to one' s children-is not 
      uncommon, in rural areas and cities alike.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents save every penny for a child to enter a 
      self-paid college if he or she fails university entrance exams. They empty 
      their pockets for a son or daughter's wedding. They do all the household 
      chores for a child living together with them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without exaggeration, Chinese parents are the most 
      thoughtful and considerate of parents in the world. Just visit an 
      amusement park on Sunday and you will see how true this statement is.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Chinese parents, or grandparents, accompany their 
      children to amusement parks, rarely do they ride the roller coaster or the 
      wonder wheel; not because they are too timid, but because they are simply 
      too busy queuing up for their children.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In much the same way, they would sacrifice their own 
      interests for the happiness of their offspring.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1990 survey in Bengbu, Anhui Province, found 62 per 
      cent of the younger families owned colour TV sets; compared with 23 per 
      cent in older families.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While 61 per cent of younger families possessed 
      refrigerators and 80 per cent had washing machines, relevant percentages 
      from the older families were 19 and 35.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the older generation's habitual thriftiness, 
      the survey said the aged spend much income on their children. Their 
      savings were further diminished by entertaining their extended families on 
      holidav.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tianjin, a survey of 100 newly-weds found 
      expenditure for the occasion averaged 11, 380 yuan ( $ 2, 147 ) . Among 
      them, 93 per cent were &quot;sponsored,?by parents, partiaily or totally.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That explains, to a large degree, why the homes of most 
      Chinese parents are rather plain, with furniture bought in the 1950s and 
      1960s. In sharp contrast, the homes of young couples display matching 
      furniture, video cassettes and audio systems. Therr houses are usually 
      carpeted and decorated with wallpaper.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When young people do not have houses of their own upon 
      marriage, their parents readily give up the best space in the house, and 
      retreat to smaller north-facing rooms.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When grandchildren are born, many grandparents 
      volunteer to be baby-sitters, caring for and bringing up the third 
      generation without complaint.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This &quot;piety&quot; towards sons and daughters is 
      very moving indeed. But I can't help thinking that it is more natural for 
      children to leave their parents and live on their own as is the practice 
      in other countries.In this way, children can better develop the habit of 
      working and living independently. The older generation, on the other hand, 
      can enjoy their later years in a more relaxed way.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, parents may extend financial help to 
      their children if the latter are really in need of it. But they need not 
      lavish care on their grown-up children. It is the children who should 
      practise the virtue of being filial to their old parents. In this way, 
      society would follow a more healthy path of development.</font></p>

      4. Bringing up Children<br>
      <br>
      [Extract from an interview.]<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One reason why the family unit is crumbling is 
      that parents have relinquished their authority over children. The 
      permissive school of thought says, &quot;Let the child do what he wants to 
      when he wants to, no matter what it is, don't warp his pecsonality, don't 
      thwart him, you'll ruin him for life.?Because of this we've got a 
      generation of spoilt selfcentred brats with no respect for their elders. 
      Children always push to see how much they can get away with; if you give 
      them nothing to push against, there are no moral limits,no moral 
      convictions will develop in the children. We have this in the 
      schools-children have much less respect for their teachers nowadays. 
      &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you define respect?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Realizing that someone else might have desires 
      also. Respect doesn't mean that when someone in authority says 
      &quot;jump&quot; you jump--that's the military approach-but young people 
      today, if they have an opinion that's different from yours, then you re 
      the fool and the re right, even if they don't have enough experience to 
      judge.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you feel about children using stwearwords?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I never hear them swear, but I saw one of my 
      daughter's diaries and it was fuil of a word that I'd have spanked her for 
      if she'd said it aloud. Swearing goes against my sensibilities. It's 
      mental laziness. If people aren't allowed to swear they use their brains 
      to find a better word.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think it's just a matter of convention or do you 
      think there's a deeper moral objection to swearing?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think it' s not done. It' s taboo in nice 
      society. We' ve been taught not to swear, and I think well-brought-up 
      people should avoid it. If I ever hear a woman use &quot;s-h-i-t&quot; I 
      think a lot less of her.&quot; (Margaret, 43, American)</font></p>

      Hard-working Dads Miss Seeing Their Kids Grow up<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Ann Landers: A number of my friends work so many 
      hours that they rarely see their children. When they finally make the 
      time,they discover that their children are grown up and have no time for 
      them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote the following piece and you are welcome to 
      share it with your readers if you think it's good enough. Sign me-Lonely, 
      Anywhere, U.S.A.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Lonely: It's excellent. You've zeroed in on one of 
      the principal problems of parenthood in the ,80s. Thanks for tossing it my 
      way.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Where Did the Years Go?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember talking to my friend a number of years ago 
      about our children. Mine were 5 and 7 then, just the ages when their daddy 
      means everything to them. I wished that I could have spent more time with 
      my kids but I was too busy working. After all, I wanted to give them all 
      the things I never had when I was growing up.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved the idea of coming home and having them sit on 
      my lap and tell me about their day. Unfortunately, most days I came home 
      so late that I was only able to kiss them good night after they had gone 
      to sleep.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is amazing how fast kids grow. Before I knew it, 
      they were 9 and 11. I missed seeing them in school plays. Everyone said 
      they were terrific, but the plays always seemed to go on when I was 
      traveling for business or tied up in a special conference. The kids never 
      complained, but I could see the disappointment in their eyes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept promising that I would have more time &quot;next 
      year? But the higher up the corporate ladder I climbed, the less time 
      there seemed to be.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly they were no longer 9 and 11. They were 14 and 
      16. Teenagers. I didn't see my daughter the night she went out on her 
      first date or my son's championship basketball game. Mom made excuses and 
      I managed to telephone and talk to them before they left the house. I 
      could hear the disappointment in their voices, but I explained as best I 
      could.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't ask where the years have gone. Those little kids 
      are 19 and 21 now and in college. I can't believe it. My job is less 
      demanding and I finally<br>
      have time for them. But they have their own interests and there is no time 
      for me. To be perfectly honest, I'm a little hurt.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems like yesterday that they were 5 and 7. I'd 
      give anything to live those years over. You can bet your life I'd do it 
      differently. But they are gone now, and so is my chance to be a real dad.<br>

      6</a>. Parents Go back to School to Teach Children Better<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having abandoned cl.asses for more than 10 years, many 
      citizens in Beijing have returned to school only because they have become 
      parents.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seek help to tackle a thorny problem: the 
      education of their &quot;only child&quot;. Some people call these children 
      the &quot;little emperors of China&quot; .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Many parents, either doting on their children or 
      behaving badly towards hem, know little about home education and thus make 
      errors, &quot; said Ding Rong, a teacher from the Fourth Middle School of 
      Beijing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a pupil was beaten to death by his mother Last 
      year in Northwest<br>
      hina's Qinghai Province, a survey was made in a Beijing primary school. Of 
      the 36 parents surveyed, everybody knew of the incident yet none were 
      aware of any defects in their system of home education.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, some said they would follow suit if their 
      children failed to study properly.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In this sense, parents' schools are badly needed, 
      &quot; said Zhen Yan, deputy general-secretary of Beijing Research 
      Association of Home Education, which is in charge of more than 3, 500 
      parents' schools in the city.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the schools, she said, was to help 
      parents to establish proper position for their children in a family and 
      society and treat them in a more enlightened way.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The schools provided a series of lectures on &quot;how 
      to educate your child properly? advice given by experts and &quot;Fumu 
      Bidu&quot; (&quot;How to become good parents&quot;) and a monthly magazine 
      published in Beijing with a circulation of 600, 000.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I never thought I would re-enter school, ?said 
      Xiao Chengjun, a 40-year-old woman worker, &quot;I was taken aback when I 
      was first asked the question 'Do you really know your child?'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jiang Bo, her 14-year-old son, was a second-year 
      student of Hujialou Middle School in Beijing's Chaoyang District. Of six 
      courses, he failed three of his first term exams. Xiao got angry and beat 
      him, but he showed no improvement.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until she took courses in a parents' school 
      that she realized beating is pointless. The following term, Jiang Bo 
      succeeded in all his lessons and helped teach his mother English.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Children are easily affected,&quot; said Ding 
      Rong, &quot;the disharmony, and often the disputes in a family places the 
      child in an awkward position. &quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents, who are the first teachers of their children, 
      need not only to instruct, but to.be educated, even by their children, 
      said an expert.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One pupil complained in a composition that his father, 
      a chain smoker, always left the smell of smoke in the living room and he 
      could not do his homework there.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another wrote that his father often played mahjong and 
      the noise kept him awake most of the night.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's the father's fault not to educate his son 
      himself,&quot; is an old saying. &quot;But, it's also the father' s fault 
      if he sets his son a bad example, &quot; said Zhen Yan.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since China pursues the policy of &quot;one child for 
      one couple&quot;, many parents are expecting too much from their children.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Taoranting Primary School, Beijing , s Xuanwu 
      District, 423 parents, over 87 per cent of the total surveyed, wanted 
      their children to become university students. About half of them 
      threaiened to punish their children if they did not pass their exams.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A parents' school set up by the First Experimental 
      Primary School suggested that parents allow their children to take over 
      some household duties on Sundays to build up their sense of 
      responsibility.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parents admitted they ignored the physiological 
      and psychological changes in their children and thus treated them with 
      beatings and scoldings.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A parent said, &quot;After attending the class, I 
      know more about my child and she also understands me more. &quot;<br>
