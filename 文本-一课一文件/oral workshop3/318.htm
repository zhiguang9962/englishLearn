      Should Women Be Treated the Same as Men?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      For Women, There Is a Long Way to Go<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-third of the people at work in Britain are women. 
      By 1975 they will, by law, be on a footing of equal pay with men. Their 
      prospects of reaching the top, however, are still far from equal.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recently-published study called Women in Top Jobs 
      examines why this should be so. For the purposes of this study four 
      researchers, two men and two women, chose women in top management in two 
      business organizations and women in senior jobs in the BBC and the Civil 
      Service. In their findings they found that although there are conventional 
      and entrenched attitudes on both sides, there is a widespread awareness 
      that no society can afford not to utilise ability.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The studies confirm that there is no basic difference 
      be tween the standards and quality of work performance of women who have 
      reached top jobs and those of men in similar positions. Nevertheless, 
      there emerged some distinctive factors in the performance of women in top 
      jobs. Women were less interested in empire-building, in office politics, 
      in status symbols. They are likely to be less forceful and competitive 
      than men.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, women tended to assume they would be 
      overtaken y men in the race to the top. However, today's young women are 
      far less philosophical about their status and are more aggressive in their 
      resentment at being treated as in some way inferior to men. On the other 
      hand, since lack of drive is one of the criticisms levelled against women, 
      perhaps this aggression is a positive advantage. Some young women, though, 
      find it very difficult to come to terms with the feeling hat 
      characteristics of authority which are acceptable in men are often not 
      acceptable in women.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reason often advanced for women failing to reach the 
      top is their desire for balance between work and a life outside work. 
      Employers know this and tend, when a woman with young children applies for 
      promotion, to treat the fact that she has young children as an important 
      factor and, given the choice, are more likely to give promotion to a man 
      than to her.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about women whose children are almost grown up? 
      Well, the writers of the study recommend a much more positive approach by 
      employers to women who want to return to their careers after their 
      children are off their hands.<br>

      2</a>. Women's Education Should Be Urged<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, a woman in a factory in Beijing was notified 
      that she was being laid off as part of the &quot;optimization&quot; work 
      force reductions in State enterprises. To escape humiliation at the hands 
      of her husband and mother-in-law, she tried to kill herself by swallowing 
      a bottle of sleeping pills.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she was rescued, her mother took her to the 
      factory director, demanding that her daughter be re-employed. Otherwise, 
      she said, the director would be responsible for any accident tbat happened 
      to her daughter. In the end, the director agreed to grant the woman a 
      leave of absence at full pay plus bonus.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is only one example of the problem for which 
      traditional theorists of women's studies and supporters of women's 
      liberation in China apparently have no ready solution. But some feminist 
      researchers recently urged that a new approach be adopted to help women 
      gain a fresh foothold in the struggle to improve their lives.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, paid employment has been seen as the 
      only passage towards women's liberation. And the rate of women's 
      employment has been used as the major criterion in determining the level 
      of women's liberation .</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after more than three decades, few Chinese 
      women feel liberated from the old burdens of family and children. They 
      feel they have simply been given more work.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We now have to admit that women's employment 
      doesn't necessarily lead to their liberation, or more exactly, to the full 
      development of their personalities,&quot; said Ma Lizhen, an editor at 
      Chinese Women magazine.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In China, &quot; she said, &quot;this road has 
      reached a dead end. &quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For nearly 40 years, China has pursued policies that 
      encourage women to join the labour force.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they have resulted in serious problems, such as low 
      efficiency in factories, strains on the State budget and a heavy load of 
      housework and child care in a family, Ma said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This employment-oriented system has hurt the women's 
      fundamental interests as well, Ma said. Women were often put into jobs in 
      heavy manual labour with men more as a demonstration of equality than 
      because they were suited for the work. This left them more dependent on 
      favourable government policies and less competitive.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A survey conducted by Ma's magazine indicates that 
      about 70 per cent of the workers who will be squeezed out of the labour 
      force in the current optimization will be wornen. The survey also reveals 
      that more women than men prefer. Stzte employment, whieh is..more secure 
      and less competitive.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect women's interesta, some women organizations 
      l;ave urged the top leadership for more favourable policies for women. But 
      some feminists now disagree.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We know that special government treatment alone 
      will not produce cornpo.tent women,&quot; Dai Qing, a noted writer and 
      journalist, said at a discussion. &quot;On the contrary, it has made them 
      weaker and more dependent. What we should do now is to help women become 
      more able and self-confident. And the only way is through education.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-standing neglect of women's education, 
      especially in the countryside, has resulted in a large proportion of 
      female illiteracy, whose negative effect on the nation's devel.opment is 
      most strikingly seen in ihe country's barely controllable birth rate.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State statistics indicate that women make up about 70 
      per cent of China's 200 million illiterates. This situation cannot be 
      expected to improve soon as hundreds of thousands of girls in the 
      countryside are being forced by their parents to drop out of school at 
      early grades to help work at home or in the fields. Girls make up an 
      estimated 70 per cent of the dropouts in the countryside, according to 
      Chinese Women magazine.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The women's movement should shift its focus from 
      employment to education,&quot; Dai urged.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If women are taught self-supporting skills, they 
      will support themselves as opportunities arise even without special care.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A good education will benefit a woman throughout 
      her life whether she is a career woman or a housewife,&quot; said Da.i, 
      who is working on a plan to set up what would be the only non-governmental 
      girls' school in the capital.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to help women stand up to the current 
      challenge is for the media to give more positive coverage to housework and 
      good housewives or househusbands, Ma suggested.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China at present cannot afford to provide publicly all 
      the services traditionally performed within the family, such as cooking, 
      washing and care for children and the elderly. But many people dislike 
      doing housework because it is unpaid and unappreciated.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ma proposed that society compensate in some way the people who work at 
      home.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thus fewer women workers would feel ashamed about 
      returuing home to do the housework, &quot; she added.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These feminist researchers have also begun reflecting 
      on the sources of and philosophy behind the current setback in the China's 
      women's liberation movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They noted that the 
      movement in China is still operating ithin the framework of male culture 
      because from the very beginning it was formulated and directed by men.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They set the male sex as a model for women to follow. 
      So women remain the second sex,&quot; Ma said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She argued that the time has come for Chinese women to 
      define their own roles in society. They should strive for a society in 
      which they can choose to work outside, or stay at home, in which they can 
      have more time to develop their own interests and improve community 
      conditions.</font></p>

      3. Two Top Career Women Say Family Also Matters<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quite a surprise for Wang Yunfeng, 58-year-old 
      general manager of the Shenyang Department Store, to find herself at the 
      head of a list of Shenyang's top 10 modern women.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list was the result of a competition organized by 
      the women's federation of Shenyang, capital of northeastern Liaoning 
      Province.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zheng Baohua, director of the federation, said that 
      Wang won the most votes not just because she is the general manager of one 
      of the largest and most-progressive department stores in the country, but 
      also because of her compassion.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang was first in the city to promote lateral ties 
      between commercial establishments, and the total volume of profits her 
      department store turned over to the State over six years was 11 times more 
      than the total investment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang's 83-year-old mother said that her husband died 
      very early. &quot;It was Yunfeng who raised her three younger 
      brothers,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;She never fails to bring me some 
      tasty pastry every time she comes home, no matter how busy she has been at 
      work.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A middle-school teacher who voted for Wang said, 
      &quot;In my opinion, in addition to career success, modern women should 
      also be independent and charming, and have a sense of freedom. This, of 
      course, has nothing to do with a person's age.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A soldier named Xiang Mingjun wrote to the federation, 
      expressing his approval of the selection of the top 10 modern women, who 
      are attentive to their husbands, tender to their children, filial to their 
      aged parents and friendly to their neighbours.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the house of another of the top 10 modern women, 
      Zhang Guiqing, general manager of Shenyang's Mulan Industrial Corporation, 
      colourful flowers can be found everywhere. Zhang was cleaning the house 
      when the reporter visited her.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Despite her fame as a boss of 27 enterprises, she 
      is a good housekeeper and an attentive housewife. She is also a capable 
      and kind mother,&quot; Zhang's husband said proudly.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang, 48, has six children, four of whom are now 
      university students. &quot;The whole family is happy at my being 
      chosen,&quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the director of the women' s federation, 
      two of the most important criteria for the top 10 modern women out of the 
      city's 2.63 million women are having been praised by authorities above the 
      city goverument level and having a harmonious and happy family.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is quite a departure from past attitudes, in the 
      days when a strong sense of family was often regarded as selfish and 
      bourgeois, Zhang said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two years ago, the story of a mo:lel woman teacher 
      who persevered in her work and ignored the pleas of her sick son was 
      widely cited with approval.<br>
