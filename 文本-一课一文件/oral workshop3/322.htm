      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should 
      Capital Punishment Be a Major Deterrent to Crime?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Text<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capital 
      Punishment Is the Only Way to Deter Criminals<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps all criminals should be required to carry cards 
      which read: Fragile: Handle with Care. It will never do, these days, to go 
      around referring to criminals as violent thugs. You must refer to them 
      politely as &quot;social misfits&quot;. The professional killer who 
      wouldn't think'twice about using his cosh or crowbar to batter some 
      harmless old lady to death in order to rob her of her meagre life-savings 
      must never be given a dose of his own medicine.He is in need of 
      &quot;hospital treatment&quot;. According to his misguided defenders, 
      society is to blame.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;A wicked 
      s,pciety breeds evil - or so the argument goes. When you listen to this 
      kind of talk, it makes you wonder why we aren't all criminals. We have 
      done away with the absurdly harsh laws of the nineteenth century and this 
      is only right. But surely enough is enough. The most senseless piece of 
      criminal legislation in Britain and a number of other countries has been 
      the suspension of capital puni'shment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The violent criminal has become a kind of hero-figures 
      in our time. He is glorified on the screen; he is pursued by the press and 
      paid vast sums of money for his &quot;memoirs&quot;. Newspapers which 
      specialise in crime-reporting enjoy enormous circulations and the 
      publishers of trashy cops and robbers stories or &quot;murder 
      mysteries&quot; have never had it so good. When you read about the 
      achievement of the great train robbers, it makes you wonder whether you 
      are reading about some glorious resistance movementg. The hardened 
      criminal is cuddled and cosseted by the sociologists on the one hand and 
      adored as a hero by the masses on the other, It' s no wonder he is a 
      privileged person who expects and receives VIP treatment wherever he goes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capital punishment used to be a major deterrent. It 
      made the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger. It gave 
      the cold-blooded poisoner something to ponder about while he was shaking 
      up or serving his arsenic cocktail. It prevented unarmed policemen from 
      being mowed down while pursuing their duty by killers armed with automatic 
      weapons. Above all, it protected the most , vulnerable members of society, 
      young children, from brutal sex-maniacs. It is horrifying to think that 
      the criminal can literally get away with murder. We all know that 
      &quot;life sentence&quot; does not mean what it says.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;After ten 
      years or so of &quot;good conduct&quot; the most desperate villain is free 
      to return to society where he will live very comfortably, thank you, on 
      the proceeds of his crime, or he will go on committing offences until he 
      is caught again. People are always will'sng to hold liberal views at the 
      expense of others. It' s aiways fashionable to pose as the defender of the 
      under-dog, so iong as you, personally, remain unaffected. Did the 
      defenders of crime, one wonders, in their desire for fair-play, consult 
      the victims before they suspended capital punishment? Hardly. You see, 
      they couldn't, because all the victims were dead.<br>

      II.Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. Can You Turn Him into a Good Guy?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why don't I give you a lift home if you live on 
      the new estate?&quot; &quot;I'd appreciate that very much,&quot; he 
      replied. I fetched my car from the parking lot and he got in with 
      &quot;Many thanks. &quot; He said no more till we were well across the 
      heath. Then, all of a sudderi, he turned to me and said, &quot;Okay. Pull 
      up here.&quot; &quot;Here?&quot; I queried. There was not a house in 
      sight, and the weather was shocking. Anyway, I pulled up. The only thing I 
      could remember after that was something thumping down hard on my head. I 
      passed out. When I came to, I was sprawled in the ditch, soaked to the 
      skin, my head pounding, my car gone and my pockets empty.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I staggered off and eventually tumbled into the 
      police-station to make a report. There was a light shining on the station 
      wall and there, lit up, was a picture of my assailant. I had walked past 
      it for the last seven days. I knew I had seen the face before. He was 
      wanted by the police for armed robbery. I thanked my lucky stars it was 
      not for murder. I looked at the name underneath the face, the face I will 
      never forget. It was-er-it was-oh, bother! I can never remember names.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. Murderers Must Be Hanged<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murderers are cruel sadistic monsters. They must be 
      hanged. What they do puts them beyond the pale of humanity. They are not 
      humans and therefore they cannot expect to be treated as humans. They must 
      be made to see the error of their ways, and the only way of doing that is 
      by hanging them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; British justice is the finest in the world,but by.not 
      imposing the death sentence people will think we are failing to punish 
      crime justly. It is the principle of justice itself that is at stake. How 
      can we claim to be a just nation if people who murder are not themselves 
      executed? An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the very basis of 
      justice.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people claim that hanging is cruel, but it is more 
      humane than the other penalties at present imposed. It is quick, and 
      thanks to modern methods, painless. It is only th'e agitators who campaign 
      against the death penalty who say it is cruel. The reality is that it is a 
      kindness to the murderer. Far better to be hanged than to suffer the slow 
      torture of life imprisonment vhich is in any case a burden on the 
      long-suffering taxpayer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other objections to life imprisonment. There 
      is the chance that the murderer may escape. He or she would then be free 
      to murder again. Nor is life imprisonment what it says. It is. only a 
      nominal sentence. In no time at all the murderer will be released. How can 
      the ordinary person feel safe knowing that there are murderers on the 
      prowl seeking their next victim?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crux of the matter is that only hanging acts as a 
      deterrent to murderers. In the past, many a would-be murderer must have 
      refrained from committing this heinous crime knowing that such an act 
      would result in certain execution. Put yourself in his or her shoes. You 
      would not commit murder knowing .that the penalty for so doing was death. 
      It is the same with murderers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So-called liberals point to the experience of other 
      European countries where the death penalty has ceased to exist. But what 
      happens in those countries is no guide to what may happen here. It is our 
      safety that is at risk, not theirs. Only the return of the death penalty 
      can ensure that we can sleep safely in our beds.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>

      3. Mediation System Helps Deter Crimes<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye Chengmei of Guojiahe Town, Xinzheng County in 
      central China's Henan Province, was beaten by her husband Pan Chenggong 
      over a trifling matter.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye's brother mobilized 14 young men with wooden sticks 
      and spades to teach his brother-in-law a lesson. Hearing the news, Pan 
      Chenggong organized more than 20 young men to fight back.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, 59-year-old Ye Bingyan, a 
      mediator, appeared and persuaded the men to stop the fight and sit down to 
      talk. Under he mediator's persuasion and his discussion of the law, Pan 
      admitted his wrongdoings and went to the home of his wife's parents to 
      make an apology.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one example of China's people's mediation 
      system which has become a major method of settling civil disputes 
      concerning marriage, family relations, housing, money and property issues.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China now has more than 1 million mediation committees 
      with over 6 million mediators. From 1982 to 1988, they settled 50 million 
      civil issues, up to 10 times the number of cases went to court.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Henan Province alone, more than 287, 000 mediators 
      from 53,642 people's mediation committees have dealt with 5,723,657 cases, 
      preventing losses for 51,343 people.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mediators enjoy popular support and respect as they 
      report fhe views, complaints and wishes of the populace to grassroots 
      governments and pass alpng the goveinment principles, poIicies, laws and 
      regulations to the masses.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The villagers speak highly of Ye Bingyan's work. They 
      say wherever and whenever disputes happen, Ye will be there. He has 
      prevented 15 gang fights, saved the lives of 14 people threatened with 
      homicide or suicide and also helped five couples reunite.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye said the key to his work is concern and love for 
      others.</font></p>

      4. Why Was She Set Free?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An armed robber walked free from the Old Bailey after a 
      kind-hearted judge heard how a nightmare attack she endured in London had 
      turned her to crime.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachet Farrington, of Maypole Road, Sheepbridge, 
      Huddersfield, was only 16 when she left Yorkshire and went to London with 
      her boyfriend.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year later she was threatening to shoot a gang of 
      drug dealers while her accomplice, a hardened criminal, tied them up.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 19-year-old pleaded guilty to robbery, having an 
      imitation firearm and aggravated burglary on July 5, 1986, but thejudge 
      deferred sentencing for six months and told her to go home.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I had intended to impose a sentenee of two years 
      in prison,&quot; said Recorder James Crespi, QC. &quot;Your co-defendant 
      was lucky to get only six years.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But I am reluctant to send you to prison. You 
      were extremely young. You came to London and got involved with drug 
      dealers. Go back to Yorkshire. Try to get a job and lead a sensible 
      life.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge was told that Rachel found herself involved 
      in London's drugs underworld soon after she arrived.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She met &quot;a man involved with drugs &quot; who 
      became her new boyfriend, said her defence counsel, Mr.Stephen Leslie.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a month the relationship had turned ugly and she 
      finally left after a horrifying attack.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;She bore a grudge, but because of things that had 
      happened earlier she did not report it to police,&quot; said Mr. Leslie.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel found a new friend, Garnet Gibson, who proved 
      equally dangerous. He was ten years older than her and had been in prison 
      many times.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she told him what she had endured in the attack by 
      her exboyfriend and his associates, Gibson told she could get her revenge 
      and Rachel agreed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Except for the grudge this was completely out of 
      character and she was completely out of her depth,&quot; said Mr.Leslie.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coupie burst into a flat in North London, where 
      Gibson, armed with an air-pistol, ordered Rachel to tie up the three men 
      found inside.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the inexperienced girl did such a poor job of it 
      that Gibson handed her the gun while he tied up the men.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victims soon realized Rachel was helpless despite 
      her threats to shoot them and they fought back.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was biushed aside by one man and finally she just 
      walked out of the flat and threw the gun away.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gibson was soon overpowered by the men and police were 
      called in.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel admitted everything to police and was bailed, 
      but she fled to Portugal and did not return until a month after Gibson's 
      trial. He was jailed for six years in July last year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel was rearrested as she entered Britain. Her 
      mother had sent her the fare home so that she could return for medical 
      treatmeot for a cyst.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court heard that Rachel was one of nine children 
      and was from an &quot;excellent&quot; family.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother, Mrs. Mary Farrington, told the judge that 
      her daughter had got out of hand after her father died of cancer and 
      Rachel lost her job through illness.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said: &quot;I have a home for her and the family is 
      willing to help her in any way we can.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="5"> 
      5</a>. Police Are Pals to Convicts<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't look like a jail at first sight. Situated in 
      Jixi County in remote<br>
      northeastern Jilin Province, this prison has neither high walls nor 
      electrified barbed wire to prevent prisoners from escaping.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small wooden fence around the compound looks like 
      those around farmers' fields. Only the wofd &quot;Cordon&quot; printed on 
      the planks suggest something unusual about the place.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1986 none of the several hundred male prisoners 
      jailed here has tried to escape. And those who have finished their 
      sentences seldom return to crime. The recidivism rate in only 0.5 per 
      cent, much lower than the 3 per cent common in other Chinese prisons.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps even more amazing is 80 per cent of the 
      released inmates have become friends of their guards.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some ex-convicts have travelled many miles back to the 
      prison to see Wang Hongwu, the head of the security police.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One sent a bull of fine breed when he heard that a bull 
      was badly needed in the prison.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quite a different story when the prison was 
      first set up years ago. The prisoners toed the line during the day but 
      were hellions at night, stealing chickens from the farmers' cottages and 
      causing all sorts of mischief .These acts precipitated many letters of 
      complaint to the authorities from residents who had become vicitms.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Wang stepped in. That was in 1984.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the prisoners' surprise, the 40-year-old security 
      veteran used talk rather than punishment to restore discipline.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang finaliy got to know most of the prisoners and 
      their concerns. Many were afraid that their spouses would divorce them and 
      their children would be left homeless. Many worried about their work and 
      life after being released.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang set out policies to reform his prisoners. He 
      developed educa tion programmes tailor-made to each prisoner's specific 
      case and family background. The prisoners were moved by his sincerity.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A larcener was frightened when his wife asked for a 
      divorce the first time she came to see him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is the last time we see each other, ?the 
      wife said. &quot;I sent the divorce papers to the court yesterday. I will 
      return with our son to my hometown in Shandong Province tomorrow.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angry and disappointed, the larcener pretended to be 
      indiffeient and said he agreed and that it didn't matter to him what she 
      did.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will find a better girl if I'm released,&quot; 
      he told his sobbing wife.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she left he burst into tears. Wang came to his 
      cell and asked why he cried since he had agreed to the divorce. The 
      larcener confessed he could not live without his wife; he simply did not 
      want to lose face before the other prisoners.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, Wang got to know that the couple loved each 
      other deeply. The wife wanted a divorce because she felt embarrassed when 
      she met his friends and was looked down upon by her mother-in-law since he 
      was put in jail.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang believed the man's reform would he harder to 
      achieve if some solution to this dilemma wasn't found. He wrote to the 
      larcener's brother-in-law, his wife's brother who was a middle-school 
      teacher in Shandong Province, urging him to persuade his sister to change 
      her mind.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten days later, Wang received a letter from Wang's 
      brother-in-law, saying that he would try to persuade his sister into 
      taking back the divorce papers and waiting for her husband.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half a month later, the wife came with her son to the 
      prison to see her busband and express her gratitude to Wang Hongwu.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The larcenef pledged to reform and Wang said he would 
      try to get him as early a release as possible.</font></p>

      6. Second Chance : a Love Story<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chen Surong and Zeng Xiangjie are factory workers in 
      Shuicheng City, Guizhou Province. They seem like any other young Chinese 
      couple: they have a two-year-old daughter, live in a two-room apartment 
      and lead a quiet and uneventful life.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't always this way.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chen Surong was a worker at a plastics factory in 
      Yunnan Province when she met Zeng Xiangjie, who worked at a Guizhou cement 
      factory, on a train in 1975. They fell in love at first sight.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two years of correspondence and occasional 
      visits, the two decided<br>
      to get married.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the arrangements were made and just before Spring 
      Festival in 1977, Chen waited for her fiance to come to Yunnan for the 
      wedding. He never showed up, nor was there a letter of explanation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten days latcr, Chen decided she must go to Guizhou and 
      find out what had happened.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; It was snowing heavily when she arrived at the Guizhou train 
      station and the roads were slushy as she trudged off to the cement #actory.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; She found Zeng's dormitory and rapped on the door of his 
      room. &quot;Xiangjie, Xiangjie...&quot; she called out, but there was no 
      answer. Finally, she found a key and uniocked the door: the room was 
      empty, messy and there was no quilt on his bed.<br>
      Confused, Chen stopped some passersby and asked them abont Zeng. They had 
      never heard of him, they told her. At last, she found an old worker, who 
      said: &quot;You'd better go to the factory security department.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young woman ran to the security department of the 
      factory, and was told that Zeng had been detained because &quot;he had 
      been stealing factory property.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chen couldn't believe her ears. But then she saw for 
      herself. in the small detention room, Zeng Xiangjie squatted behind a 
      locked door, and she knew it was true.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Xiangjie, what's the matter with you?&quot; she 
      asked him.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not raise his eyes. He covered his face with his 
      hands and wept.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Come on, what did you do?&quot; Chen insisted.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sorry... I deceived you. .. I am a guilty 
      man, I'm ruined...&quot; Zeng numbled as tears roiled down lais cheeks.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she realized it, Chen was aiready out on the 
      street, running madly for the railway station.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite a while afterwards, she could not steep or 
      eat. When she saw a letter from Zeng, she thcew it away, and then she 
      burst into tears.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to be an endless ordeal. But as she calmed 
      down, Chen found she could not forget Zeng, or at deast the man she knew. 
      Hadn't he been so kind and helpful at Guiyang train station? When he came 
      to visit her, didn' t he always bring whatever she needed? Hadn't he 
      seemed so smart and so considerate?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Chen felt she must not lose Zeng but help him 
      make a new beginning instead of severing the tie between them completely.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She retrieved the letter she had thrown away. It was a 
      short letter: &quot;Surong, I'm sorry,for I have deceived you. Can you 
      forgive me? I will start anew and be an honest man. You take my word for 
      it...&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, Chen was back at the cement factory. She 
      met Xiangjie and told him, &quot;A young man should follow the right road, 
      otherwise, he will never find true love.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeng was released, but he was obsessed and worried that 
      Chen might leave him at any time, or that he might be sent back to the 
      public security bureau again. He could not concentrate on his work and as 
      a result, broke three of his ribs in an accident.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His factory leaders were very concerned about Zeng's 
      injury, and often went to the hospital to see him. They also sent four 
      young workers to attend to him in turn. During the time he was in the 
      hospital, Chen was at his bedside holding his hand.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeng was moved to teais. &quot;I thought I was 
      ruined,&quot; he said, &quot;but now with your help and concern, I am 
      confident that I can be an honest and good man again. When I recover, I'll 
      work very hard to repay your kindness.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon afterwards, Zeng recovered fully and as he had 
      promised, came out of the hospital a different man. He was always the 
      first to start work in his workshop and the last to leave. For two years, 
      he never asked for leave and was awarded the title of an &quot;advanced 
      worker.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1981, Zeng and Chen were finally married. Zeng's 
      factory gave the newlyweds a two-room apartment, and Chen managed to 
      transfer to her husband's factory.<br>
