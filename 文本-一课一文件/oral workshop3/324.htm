      Does Fashion Contribute Anything to Society?<br>

      Make np, Dress up, Warm up, Brighten'up<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When 43-year-old Wang I.ongzhu stepped out of a beauty 
      parlour in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province in East China, she felt 
      all the people around were staring at her with admiration.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &quot;Years ago, it would be unusual for a 
      middleaged woman like me to make up because Chinese women who have married 
      and raised children usually do not care much about their appearance.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When I came home and looked in the mirror, I 
      found myself younger and I felt relaxed and confident,&quot; she added.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang, an official of a pharmaceutical factory in 
      Nanjing, believes a good appearance may leave people with a better 
      impression in social contacts. She goes to the Nanjing Dongfang beauty 
      parlour centre to have face massotherapy once a week.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Founded three months ago, the centre has helped more 
      than 100 middie-aged and older people to improve their appearance.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Yahui, director of the centre, said,&nbsp; 
      &quot;Everyone gets old. But we can keep our youthful appearance longer 
      through daily care.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Middle-aged and older people in China are now breaking 
      with the conventional idea and paying more attention to keeping fit and 
      caring about their appearance.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a shop assistant of the Taiping Department 
      Store, who looks after a counter selling clothes specially for rniddle-aged 
      and older people, more and more of her senior customers like to buy 
      fashionable and bright-coloured clothes. The dark and grey uniforms which 
      used to be popular among old people are now unsellable.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He Minsheng, director of a city committee looking after 
      affairs concerning the aged, said that when people are getting old, they 
      often begin to feel useless and lose interest in life. The purpose of the 
      committee is to help them overcome these iroubles.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said the city has set up more than 400 recreational 
      and sports organizations to promote various activities for older people.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the morning, old people can be found 
      performing disco, qigong(a system of deep breathing exercises) and other 
      exercises in gardens and parks.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, not all middle-aged and older people in China 
      openly express their views about their wish to remain in good physical 
      condition.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reporter from a local weekly aimed at senior citizens 
      complained that about 1, 000 people signed for a recent healthcare 
      exercise training course, but few of them are willing to be interviewed. 
      The reporter said, &quot;Maybe these people are still afraid of being 
      laughed at.<br>

      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">II. Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. &quot;New 
      Fashions in Clothing Are Created Solely for the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Commercial Exploitation of Women<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever you see an old film, even one made as little 
      as ten years ago, you cannot help being struck by the appearance of the 
      women taking part. Their hair- styles and make-up look dated: their skirts 
      look either too long or too short: their general appearance is, in fact, 
      slightly ludicrous. The men taking part in the film, on the other hand, 
      are clearly recognizable. There is nothing about their appearance to 
      suggest that they belong to an entirely different age.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This illusion is created by changing fashions. Over the 
      years, the great majority of men have successfully resisted all attempts 
      to make them change their style of dress. The same cannot be said for 
      women. Each year a few so-ca lled &quot;top designers&quot; in Paris or 
      London lay down the law and women the whole world over rush to obey. The 
      decrees of the designers are unpredictable and dictatorial. This year, 
      they decide in their arbitrary fashion, skirts will be short and waists 
      will be high; zips are in and buttons are out . Next year the law is 
      reversed and far from taking exception, no one is even mildly surprised.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If women are mercilessly exploited year after year, 
      they have only themselves to blame. Because they shudder at the thought of 
      being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are annually 
      blackmailed by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been 
      worn only a few times have to be discarded because of the dictates of 
      fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing 
      in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that 
      she has nothing to wear.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing fashions are nothing more than the deliberate 
      creation of waste. Many women squander vast sums of money each year to 
      replace clothes that have hardly been worn. Women who cannot afford to 
      discard clothing in this way, waste hours of their time altering the 
      dresses they have. Hem-lines are taken up or let down; waist-lines are 
      taken in or let out; neck-lines are lowered or raised, and so on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one can claim that the fashion industry contributes 
      anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely 
      concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability. They are 
      only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact 
      that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, providing they look 
      right. There can hardIy be a man who hasn,t at some time in his life 
      smiled at the sight of a woman shivering in a flimsy dress on a wintry 
      day, or delicately picking her way through deep snow in dainty shoes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When comparing men and women in the matter of fashion, 
      the conclusions to be drawn are obvious. Do the constantly changing 
      fashions of women's clothes, one wonders, reflect basic qualities of 
      fickleness and instability? Men are too sensible to let themselves be 
      bullied by fashion clesigners. Do their unchanging styles of dress reflect 
      basic qualities of stability and reliability? That is for you to decide.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>

      2. For Fashion-mad Youth Money Is No Object<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young women in Beijing are showing a new look in 
      fashions this year. They are wearing elegant long trouser-like skirts and 
      loose pantalets with a connected top, both made of colourful satin, silk 
      and polyester<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a popular saying among young people in the capital 
      nowadays goes - &quot;Fashion for women and labels for men.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fashion had been lang neglected in Beijing. During the 
      &quot;cultural revolution&quot; (1966-1976), the city was filled with 
      people clad in blue, grey, black and green. Army uniforms were the norm. 
      Green caps, suits and coats were in vogue.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no longer. The drab look is no more.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever there are shops, there are some that sell the 
      latest fashions in garments a,nd shoes. Street pedlars and private 
      clothing store owners have been trying to collect new designs from all 
      over the country and to put them on display in ihe markets as soon as 
      possible.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prominent Beijing garment companies such as Blue Sky, 
      Leimeng and Zaocun have been replaced in popularity by Smart Garments Lrd, 
      Wacoal Co. I.td. and De-Carty, all of which are joint ventures. Although 
      their clothes are much more expensive than those in ordinary shops, they 
      are selling very well.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bus:tling night market of Xidan, one of the 
      busiest shopping centres in Beijing, a young woman was heard commenting on 
      a dress marked at 319 yuan.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It would cost three months of my salary, but it's 
      really beautiful,&quot; she said. &quot;It's very difficult for people 
      like me who are living on fixed salaries to find som.ething satisfactory. 
      What we like is extremely expensive, and what we can afford we 
      dislike.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A young woman shop assistant said she was attracted to 
      a beautiful skirt one day, but gave up buying it because one of her 
      colleagues had one just like it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I want to be different,&quot; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nike, Adidas and other world-famous sportswear and 
      shoes have become fashionable among young men who are eager to be with the 
      incrowd. A pair of shoes can set them back 160 yuan, more than a month's 
      salary.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Young peop(e nowadays spend money like they had a 
      hole in their pocket,&quot; said an elderly shop assistant. &quot;They buy 
      whatever they like regardless of the price.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm not against dressing well, but you have to 
      survive.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the fourth floor of the Wangfujing Department Store, 
      a young man chose a 398-yuan dress for his girlfriend.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Since I run a beauty salon, I have no problem 
      affording a coat like this,&quot; the man said casually. &quot;Nowadays 
      people like to start new things to distinguish themselves,&quot; a 
      sociologist commented. &quot;It is a psychological breakthrough. People 
      try to preserve their own value and their personality.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      3. Hong Devoted to Fashion Career<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fashion designer Hong Xia is a 
      woman. with a mission in life:she hopes to turn Guangzhou into a fashion 
      centre rivalling Paris, Milan, Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong, now a designer at 
      Guangzhou University, staged a solo fashion show in 1986, held fashion 
      lectures and night-schools and published articles on fashion. She then 
      went on to teach at Guangzhou University in 1988 and is now writing a book 
      describing the Guangzhou fashion world.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her career in fashion started when she was 
      enrolled in the Central Academy of Arts and Designs in Beijing in 1981. 
      Before that, she had been a mechanical worker for eight years after 
      graduating from middle school in 1973 in Guangzhou.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fashion design had just started its 
      rise in popularity at the time I was studying in Beijing,&quot; she said. 
      &quot;It was fascinating because it was new.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was attracted to the Shenzhen Special 
      Economic Zone two years later when she graduated and went to an area where 
      large-scale construction was underway and the pace of everyday life was 
      quickening.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One year later, after gaining 
      experience in all aspects of clothes eduction, she received her first 
      designing assignment: for a batch of summer clothes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't know how to describe my 
      feelings for my first independent designs,&quot; she said. &quot;t1 lot of 
      questions came to mind which I never thought of at school: What should I 
      design? What materials should I use? What colours should I choose? What 
      styles will be popular? All this forced me to begin a market survey.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It came as a bit of a surprise when 
      she saw her summer fashions welumed by customers. For the first time, she 
      blended the needs of the narket with her own designs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Shenzhen, Hong benefited from watching 
      Hong Kong TV and reading the latest fashion magazines from all over the 
      world to keep pace uith international trends. Her big chance came when she 
      joined the nahonal &quot;Adult Spring-Autumn Fashion Designs 
      Competition&quot; sponsored by China Fashions Magazine and Central 
      Television in 1985.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong was one of the five major winners 
      thanks to her unconventional women's fashion designs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the private fashion market in Guangzhou 
      is to date only a duplication and sales centre of new overseas fashions, 
      according to Hong Xia. &quot;It is active in buying and selling the latest 
      styles form Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan but weak in designing its own 
      styles, ?she said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential for the sale of fashion goods 
      throughout China has stimulated the development of the city's fashion 
      market. Hundreds of stores selling world-brand clothes have sprung up.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers to these stores, she said, are 
      mainly people from art circles,management personnel and young women 
      working in hotels and offices. Prices range from 100 to 4, 000 yuan. 
      People involved in the fashion business in Shanghai, Beijing, Dalian and 
      Qingdao are also frequent customers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Although at present you seldom see styles 
      designed by the city, s own designers, Guangzhou is gradually becoming a 
      Hong Kong-style fashion market with Ihe appearance of these fashion 
      stores,&quot; she said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An obvious disadvantage for Guangzhou 
      to develop into a fashion centre is the lack of its own fashion designers, 
      and people in the city do not have the dress sense to appreciate fashion 
      designs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realizing this, Hong decided to teach.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thought I should do my best to let 
      more people know something about fashion designing by holding fashion 
      shows, lectures and nightschools,&quot; Hong said.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That was a turning point in my 
      career,&quot; she said. &quot;It paved my way towards success.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong Xia now has 25 students in her 
      class in Guangzhou University for a two-year course. She teaches them not 
      only the fashion theories but tells them about her own experiences as a 
      designer and as a privare businessperson.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong has already seen the achievements of her 
      teaching. In a national Youth Fashion Designs Competition nine of her 
      students were chosen as excellent winners and one of her students received 
      the first award.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a fashion designer and a business 
      woman,'Hong Xia has sold her works to fashion businesses in the United 
      States, Japan, Australia and Hong Kong.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now I am looking forward to setting up a 
      private fashion company to design fashions for foreign people staying in 
      Guangzhou,&quot; she said.&quot;I'm working hard on it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <a name="4">4</a>.Jewellery Shining Once Again in China<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strolling through nearly every city, 
      you can find jewellery shops and women wearing necklaces, earrings, rings 
      and bracelets.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Things have changed 
      dramatically,&quot; said a middle-aged woman who had just bought a diamond 
      ring at a jewellery exhibition held by a small arts and crafts store in 
      Beijing's Chaoyang District.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm the kind of woman who loves 
      dressing up more than anything else, &quot; she said. &quot;But to my 
      great regret, during the 'cultural revolution,' when I was a young woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I couldn't make myself beautiful. by wearing fashionable clothes and 
      beautiful jewellery. Now I am happy to have a chance to wear jewellery 
      again now that it is becoming popular in China.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People, both young and old, women and 
      men, have begun showing new interest in jewellery, especially since 1982, 
      when the government reopened its domesitc gold market after it was shut 
      down for 21 years. But different people think of jewellery in different 
      ways.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Recompense<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fu Cong, 60, a retired man in Hohhot, 
      capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, spent 700 yuan he had 
      saved up for a couple of years to buy his wife a gold wedding ring for her 
      58th birthday.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I consider it a recompense,&quot; he 
      said. &quot;When we were married 30 years ago, I had neither the money nor 
      the idea to buy her a wedding ring since in the 1950s, a gift like this 
      would have been considered wasteful and bourgeois.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overjoyed at wearing the precious gift her 
      husband gave her, his wife said that she has taken the ring as a good 
      sustenance and hopes that their marriage will last forever.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wearing rings, earrings, necklaces and other 
      ornamental jewels was very popular when I was a child,&quot; she said. 
      &quot;My ears were pierced a few days after I was born as were most little 
      girls' at that time, and I began wearing a pair of earrings when I was a 
      child.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said that she never had a 
      necklace or a ring because wearing jewellery was no longer done when she 
      grew up, and people were criticized for wearing jewels.<br>
      Wang Weilan, another woman in Hohhot, has another view toward jewellery.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months ago, she spent several 
      thousand yuan on a gold ring and a pair of earrings.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I would rather rely on gold and 
      jewels than on paper currency for protection against price 
      increases,&quot; she said. &quot;Although I've put some of my money in a 
      bank, I'm still afraid of devaluation.&quot;<br>

      Wealth<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many elderly people, jewellery is no longer an 
      ornament to enhance beauty but a symbol of wealth or a memento. So they 
      pay less attention to the external design and care much more about 
      intrinsic value.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But most who wear jewellery thess days do so for 
      beauty's sake.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even a few years ago, I considered jewellery a 
      luxury. Ipreferred durable consumer goods, like colour televisions, 
      refrigerators and highgrade furniture. Now that I have these things I 
      think of jewellery as a necessity, &quot; said He Ming, a 24-year-old 
      Beijing woman.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheap, imitation gold and ivory rings and necklaces 
      were very popular a couple of years ago and had a special appeal to young 
      women with low incomes. They liked gilt necklaces and earrings, because 
      they look like the real thing but were much cheaper.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with expanding jewellery markets, the introduction 
      of foreign products and rising living standards, many people, especially 
      young women, have become more selective and are no longer satisfied with 
      traditional designs of rings, earrings, necklaces and bracelets. And 
      they're paying great attention to value as well.<br>
