      Is the Prospect of Growing Old a Bleak One?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The Prospect of Growing OId Is Horrifying<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father has an organic brain disease. It's 
      Parkinson's disease, and in his case it has led to the additional trauma 
      of Parkinsonian dementia. He is in and out of reality. At times, he is as 
      clever as can be--until he sees snakes or space stations or trucks in his 
      room.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother and I together could no longer handle him at 
      home. He required physical assistance for every move and his behavior 
      became too unpredictable. At home, he never slept and neither did we. He 
      also suffers from a narrowing of his spinal column, which pinches the 
      nerves in his back and leaves him unable to find a painless position in 
      bed.</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We brought him to the hospital, where he stayed for 
      seven weeks, until its utilization review board decided he no longer 
      needed hospital care. They kicked him out.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We put him in a nursing home, recommended as top of the 
      line, with one nursing aide for every 15 patients(if everyone shows up for 
      work). My father cannot feed himself nor get to and from the bathroom. One 
      nurse's aide with 15 patients cannot attend to his needs.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my mother spends seven to eight hours each day at 
      the nursing home. My father cries, yells and does all he knows to keep her 
      there. He thinks he is home and can't understand why she leaves him each 
      evening. He thinks she has other men.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tells her she is boring a hole in his heart. She 
      cries. The nursing home costs $ 45, 000 per year. My father is lucky: 
      Unlike most Americans, he has a decent union pension. But his pension, 
      added to his Social Security paymet, puts him over the income eligibility 
      levei for Medicaid in Florida. Not only is he disqualified from receiving 
      Medicaid itself, his insurance only pays for claims certified by Medicaid.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the diseases afflicting my father are fatal. He 
      is 69 year's old, and both his parents lived to be 90. My family could be 
      spending $ 45, 000 a year for the next 20 years. It's money we don't have.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother is heartsick. They worked and saved and 
      bought insurance all their lives so that they could grow old in peace Now 
      she doesn't know how she will live, let alone how to take care of him.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lawyer suggested to my mother that she divorce my 
      father. Yet she is the one who feeds him, cleans him and loves him. Now, 
      after 48 years of marriage, she is being counseled to divorce him so she 
      can keep some funds back from the nursing home. We think about canceling 
      his pension, but then neither of them would have any income.<br>

      2. The Oldest People in the World<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of people in the world are a hundred years 
      old--or more. There are about two thousand centenarians in Britain alone, 
      and certain parts of the world are famous for the long lives of their 
      inhabitants: Georgia in the Soviet Union, the Vilacamba Valley in Ecuador, 
      and the home of the Hunzas in the Himalayas. But the oldest person in the 
      world is Japanese. In 1983 Mr.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Shigechiyo 
      Izumi, aged 118, held first place in The Guinness Book of Records . He was 
      born on June 29th, 1865 and beat the previous record on his 114th 
      birthday. Before Mr. Izumi broke the record, the longest life was that of 
      an American woman, Mrs. Eveline Filkins. She lived for 113 years, 214 
      days, from 1815 to 1928. During her lifetime she saw the invention of the 
      first camera, the first telephone, the first car, the first aeroplane and 
      the first television. There are official papers to prove the date of birth 
      of Mr. Izumi and Mrs. Filkins, but many other people claim to be as old or 
      older.</font></p>

      3. The Secret of a Long Life<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do so many people live to a healthy old age in 
      certain parts of the world? What is the secret of their long lives? Three 
      things seem to be very important: fresh air, fresh food and a simple way 
      of life. People work near their homes in the clean, mount.ain air instead 
      of travelling long distances to work by bus, car or train. They do not sit 
      all day in busy offices or factories, but work hard outdoors in the 
      fields. They take more exercise and eat less food than people in the 
      cities of the West. For years the Hunzas of the Himalayas did not need 
      policemen, lawyers or doctors. There was no crime, no divorce and not much 
      illness in thier society. They were a happy, peaceful people, famous all 
      over India for their long, healthy lives.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. How Long Will You Live?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to live to be a hundred? Here are some 
      rules for success. First, choose your parents and grandparents carefully. 
      If they lived to a good old age, so will you. Secondly, live in the right 
      place. If you were not born in Georgia or Ecuador, there are other healthy 
      places in the world, like East Anglia in Britain. Thirdly, c.hoose the 
      right kind of job. Doctors, dentists and bus-drivers die young. Farmers, 
      priests and orchestral conductors live much longer. If you are in the 
      wrong kind of job, you can still improve your way of life.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old man in the Caucasus was talking about his past 
      life. &quot;I was young then,&quot; he said, as he described his 87th 
      year. His secret and his advice was: &quot;Think young and stay young.?An 
      old woman from Missouri, USA, gives this advice . &quot;Drink a little 
      whisky and some warm beer every day.&quot; An English lady centenarian 
      just said, &quot;Take a cold bath every morning.&quot; On her 102nd 
      birthday Miss Julia Thompson 2xplained the secret of her long and happy 
      life. &quot;Never have anything to do with men,&quot; she said. The 
      shortest, simplest piece of advice came from Mr.Jim Chapman, aged 103. 
      &quot;Just keep breathing,&quot; he told reporters. What about Mr. Izumi? 
      &quot;I watch TV,&quot; he said, &quot;and I never worry.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do you really want to be a hundred? What's wrong 
      with the old saying, &quot;Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we 
      die.&quot;?</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      5. Colleges for Old People Blooming<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China has set up 916 colleges for senior citizens, 
      educating about 200,000 people in the pastfive years.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The colleges offer more than 60 courses ranging from 
      calligraphy, painting and gardening to qigong, massage and foreign 
      languages.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students are mainly retired government 
      functionaries but, according to an official from the Association of 
      Colleges for the Elderly, the colleges are trying to serve senior citizens 
      from the whole of society.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some institutions are already giving courses in 
      gardening, crop planting and animal husbandry to old people from the 
      countryside. According to a poll conducted by the Harbin senior citizens 
      college in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang, of its first 200 
      graduates, 71 per cent had recovered from chronic diseases since their 
      registration, and 85 per cent were &quot;very confident&quot; that they 
      will live longer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the students are again working for the society 
      instead of being just consumers. During each semester, about 60 per cent 
      of the students of the college serve society while studying.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      6. The Fulfilment of One's Dreams<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's only natural to look forward to something better. 
      We do it all our lives. Things may never really improve, but at least we 
      always hope they will. It is one of life's great ironies that the longer 
      we live, the less there is to look forward to. Retirement may bring with 
      it the fulfilment of a lifetime's dreams. At last there will be time to do 
      all the things we never had time for. From then on, the dream fades. 
      Unless circumstances are exceptional, the prospect of growing really old 
      is horrifying. Who wants to live long enough to become a doddering wreck? 
      Who wants to revert to that most dreaded of all human conditions, a second 
      childhood?<br>
