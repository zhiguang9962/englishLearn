      Are Cars Doing More Harm Than Good?<br>

      Cars Only Bring Peogle Trouble<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today any Chinese can enjoy the luxury of owning a 
      private car--if he can afford it, that is. And to be able to afford it, 
      you have first of all to pay a five or six figure sum to buy a machine. 
      Even the toylike Polish midget Fiat costs something<br>
      like 20,000 yuan. Any decent car would cost ten times that much.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But however large this initial sum you have to pay, the 
      real drain on your purse is yet to come, in the running and maintenance of 
      the machine--the various taxes, the fuel, and of course the repairs. The 
      last item especially is a bottomless<br>
      pit. Any single repair may cost you thousands. If your car is of foreign 
      make and you have to change a spare part, then God help you!</font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial burden is not your only worry. When you 
      buy a car, you are like an elderly.man who marries a young wife. You have 
      to guard her jealously, and protect her from prowling wolves who are 
      constantly at your gate. A famous violinist who bought a second-hand car 
      last year had to buy a pair of binoculars at the same time too, because he 
      had to watch the car from his window every few minutes. Not only the car 
      itself, but accesories such as rear-view mirrors, batteries, even wheels 
      are all objects of prey.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I once read about a man in Shanghai who had the luck to 
      win a car in a savings' lottery. Of course it was the cheapest of all 
      cars, a Polish midget Fiat mentioned above. Nevertheless for the rnan who 
      won it, it was the chance of a life time, and he could hardly believe in 
      his own luck. But his joy was short-lived, for the troubles that followed 
      were enough to put any man into utter despair.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all he couldn't get a license plate. He was 
      sent from place to place, and after months of running around and after 
      having handed out around four thousand yuan ( the greater part of which as 
      &quot;good will gifts&quot;) he finally becarr.e the proud legal owner of 
      the car.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his troubles were by no means over. Like the 
      violinist, he found he had to guard his newly-wedded &quot;bride&quot; 
      from all sorts of violations. In fact the whole family had to take turn s 
      for the &quot;night shift&quot;, which meant sleep in the car to protect 
      her from night prowlers. Our friend had the hardest time because he is a 
      tall fellow with long limbs.For him to sleep in a toy-like midget car was 
      literally a form of torture. When he clarnbered out of the car in the 
      morning, he found he could hardly walk. Obviously things couldn't go on 
      like that and so in the end he found a place to park his car for the 
      night-in a school about two bus-stops away. The distance was noth ing 
      compared with the parking fee he had to pay the school every month.But the 
      greatest inconvenience was the fact that he had to get his car out of the 
      school before eight every morning when school starts.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With conditions as they are in our country, one may 
      well wonder who would ever want to own a private car. According to 
      officially published figures, there were over 4,000 private cars in 
      Beijing at the beginning of this year. That's a big leap from just over a 
      hundred five years ago-a forty times increase. But in proportion to 
      Beijing's population, the figure is piteously low, probably the lowest 
      compared to other capitals in the world.<br>

      II . Read<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the following passages. Underline the important 
      viewpoints while reading.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      1. The Advantages of the Car<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the motor car is becoming more and more 
      widespread in the twentieth century. As an increasing number of countries 
      develop both technically and economically, so a larger proportion of the 
      world's population is able to buy and use a car. Possessing a car gives a 
      much greater degree of mobility, enabling the driver to move around 
      freely. The owner of a car is no longer forced to rely on public transport 
      and is, therefore, not compelled to work locally. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">He can choose 
      from a greater variety of jobs and probably changes his work more 
      frequently as he is not restricted to a choice within a small radius. 
      Travelling to work by car is also more comfortable than having to use 
      public transport, the driver can adjust the heating in winter and the air 
      conditioning in summer to suit his own needs and preference. There is no 
      irritation caused by waiting for trains, buses or underground. trains, 
      standing in long patient queues, or sitting on draughty platforms, for as 
      long as half an</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      hour sometimes. With the building of good fast motorways long distances 
      can be covered rapidly and pleasantly. For the first time in fhis century 
      also, many people are now able to enjoy their leisure time to the full by 
      making trips to the country or seaside at the weekends, instead of being 
      confined to their immediate neighbourhood. This feeling of independence, 
      and the freedom to go where you please, is perhaps the greatest advantage 
      of the car.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      2. The Drawbacks of the Car<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When considering the drawbacks, perhaps pollution is of 
      prime importance. As more and more cars are produced and used, so the 
      emission from their exhaust pipes contains an ever larger volume of 
      poisonous gas. Some of the contents of this gas, such as lead, not only 
      pollute the atmosphere but cause actual harm to the health of people. Many 
      of the minor illness of modern industrial society, headaches, tiredness, 
      and stomach upsets are thought to arise from breathing polluted air. 
      Doctors' surgeries are full of people suffering from illness caused by 
      pollution. </font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is also 
      becoming increasingly difficult to deal with the problem of traffic in 
      towns. Most of the important cities of the world suffer from traffic 
      congestion. In fact, any advantage gained in comfort is often cancelled 
      out in city by the frustration caused by traffic jams, endless queues of 
      cars crawling bumper to bumper through all the main streets. As an 
      increasing number of traffic regulation schemes are devised, the poor 
      bewildered driver finds himself diverted and forced into one-way systems 
      which cause even greater delays than the traffic jams they are supposed to 
      prevent. The soaring cost of petrol and the increased licence fees and 
      road tax all add to the driver's worries In fact, he must sometimes wonder 
      if the motor car is such a boon, or just a menace.</font></p>

      3. Cars Are the Major Cause of Road Accidents<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the health point of view we are living in a 
      marvellous age. We are immunised from birth against many of the most 
      dangerous diseases. A large number of once fatal illnesses can now be 
      cured by modern drugs and surgery. It is almost certain that one day 
      rsmedies will be found for the most stubborn remaining disease. The 
      expectation of life has increased enormously. But though the possibility 
      of living a long and happy life is greater than ever before, every day we 
      witness the incredible slaughter of men, women and children on the roads. 
      Man versus the motor-car! It is a never- ending battle which man is 
      losing. Thousands of people the world over are killed or horribly 
      mutilated each year and we are quietly sitting back and letting it happen.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been rightly said that when a man is sitting 
      behind a steering wheel, his car becomes the extension of his personality. 
      There is no doubt that the motor-car often brings out a man's very worst 
      qualities. People who are normally quiet and pleasant may become 
      unrecognizable when they are behind a steering-wheel. They swear, they are 
      ill-mannered and aggressive, wilful as two-year-olds and utterly selfish. 
      All their hidden frustrations, disappointments and jealousies seem to be 
      brought to the surface by the act of driving.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surprising thing is that society smiles so benignly 
      on the motorist and seems to condone his behaviour. Everything is done for 
      his convenience. Cities are allowed to become almost uninhabitable because 
      of heavy traffic; towns are made ugly by huge car parks; the countryside 
      is desecrated by road networks; and the mass annual slaughter becomes 
      nothing more than a statistic, to be conveniently forgotten.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to driving, the laws of some 
      countries are notoriously lax and even the strictest are not strict 
      enough. The driving test should be standardised and made far more 
      difficult than it is; all drivers should be made to take a test every 
      three years or so; the age at which young peopleare allowed to drive any 
      vehicle should be raised to at least 21; all vehicles should be put 
      through stringent annual tests for safety.Even the smallest amount of 
      alcohol in the blood can impair a person's driving ability.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Present 
      drinking and driving laws (where they exist) should be made much stricter. 
      Maximum and minimum speed limits should be imposed on all roads. These 
      measures may sound inordinately harsh, but surely nothing should be 
      considered as too severe if it results in reducing the annual toll of 
      human life. After all, the world is for human beings, not motor-cars.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      4. Road Accidents<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are far too many road accidents in this country: 
      too many deaths and too many people injured. One wonders who are most to 
      blame: drivers or pedestrians. Some people say that the blame cannot be 
      put fairly without considering the roads and the whole transport system. 
      In crowded cities like London, Birmingham or Manchester, road conditions 
      are so chaotic that both driver and pedestrian often endanger lives 
      through no fault of their own. Such deficiencies as too many road signs, 
      faulty traffic lights, sudden narrowing of a street, congested parking are 
      all a sure indication of bad ioad conditions. On the other hand, many 
      experts are convinced that the larger part of the blame for the death toll 
      must be put on persons and persons alone: drivers who drive too fast and 
      without any consideration for others, drivers</font></p>
      <p>　</p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      One Day We May Need to Use This Ambulance</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman">who think they 
      are safe at the wheel even though they have drunk too much alcohol, 
      drivers who, out of some curious sense of power, are incapable of 
      understanding that their car is a lethal weapon if improperly used. 
      Pedestrians, likewise, must share the guilt: stepping off the pavement 
      without first looking to the left or right, crossing roads when the 
      traffic lights are against them, jumping off a moving bus. To be fair, 
      pedestrians, drivers and road conditions are all to blame.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One looks forward to the day when the motor car has 
      been replaced by some less dangerous means of transport.</font></p>
      <p>　</p>

      6. The Alcohol Limit and the Punishment<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limit of the amount of alcohol a driver is allowed 
      to have in his blood is 80 milligrams for every 100 millilitres of blood: 
      that is about one and a half litres of beer, or one double whisky.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the driver is convicted of &quot;being drunk while 
      in charge of a motor vehicle&quot;, the usual sentence is a ) a heavy 
      fine. b ) disqualification from driving for 12 months.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the driver causes an accident, the sentence can be 
      stricter. For example, a drunken driver who killed a pedestrian was sent 
      to prison for 9 months, as well as being fined and losing his licence for 
      a year. (A demonstrator who destroyed a tennis court as a protest was sent 
      to prison for 18 months.)</font></p>

      7. How Do Police Detect Drunk Drivers<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the police suspect you of having drunk more than the 
      limit (see above) they can ask you to blow into a breathalyser, which is a 
      plastic bag; if the crystals inside turn green, the police can take you to 
      a police station and take a blood sample. If the driver has had a drink 
      less than 20 minutes before he is stopped, the breathalyser cannot be 
      used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officially the police can stop you only if they think 
      you are driving badly, but in practice they sometimes simply stop drivers, 
      and give them the breathalyser test.</font></p>

      8. Different Opinions on the Alcohol Limit<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief Inspector Kale (Head of Southern Police) would 
      like the alcohol limit lowered and sentences made tougher.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Nash (a lawyer) is often professionally involved 
      in drinking and driving cases. She thinks judges are too kind, and that 
      seniences should be made tougher.<br>
      Dr.Smalby has been asked to explain the effects of alcohol. He says fhat 
      it slows down reactions, and affects vision.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs.Houghton, whose six-year-old son, Tommy, was killed 
      by a drunken driver. She thinks the driver should have been sent to prison 
      for life.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.Lambert knocked down a pedestrian while slightly 
      drunk. He feels very guilty, and is convinced it would not have happened 
      if he had not had a few drinks.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.Crosby lost his licence six months ago, and, as a 
      result, his job. He feels he was driving quite properly, and that the law 
      was, and is, far too stiict.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs.Austin lost her licence after having three 
      whiskies. She was driving because her husband was drunk. She thinks she 
      drives perfectly well after three whiskies and that the law is unfair.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Connery (a famous racing driver) thinks that 
      everybody reacts differently to alcohol. (He would be quite safe after 
      drinking three whiskies. ) He thinks the limit should be raised.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabrielle Savage (a famous film actress) thinks ihe law 
      should be abolished because it stops people having a good time.<br>
