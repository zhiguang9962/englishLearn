&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A farmer who lived in a small village suffered from a severe pain in the chest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This never seemed to get any better. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The farmer eventually decided that he would consult a doctor in the nearest town. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But as he was a miserly person he thought he would find out what he would have to pay this doctor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was told that a patient had to pay three pounds for the first visit and one pound for the second visit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The farmer thought about this for a long time, and then he decided to go and consult the doctor in the town. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As he came into the doctor's consulting room, he said casually,  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Good morning, doctor. Here I am again." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The doctor was a little surprised. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He asked him a few questions, examined his chest and then took the pound which the farmer insisted on giving him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then the doctor said with a smile,  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Well, sir. There's nothing new. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Please continue to take the same medicine I gave you the first time you came to see me." </T> <BR>
