<T TYPE=SEN> <P align=center><B>All about me</B></P> </T> <BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'm twelve years old. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm large for my age and have big feet which I am self-conscious about. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I look like both my mum and my dad but in different ways. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have fair hair and blue eyes like my dad, and a mouth and expression like my mum. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My nose is like my mother's and definitely nothing like my father's ("thank goodness"). </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I am very like my mum in temperament, though I don't have her very hot temper. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'm rather a tomboy but I'm not violent. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I hate fighting and arguments. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I hate being laughed at and some teasing hurts me more than I show. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I tend to sulk when I am annoyed and I tend to be a bit oversensitive. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Friendship is important to me with people of all ages. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My home is very important to me and I would hate to be sent to a boarding school. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On the whole I'm a fairly tidy person. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I am quite creative with my hands. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I like making models, pendants and candles as well as other things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I like acting and music, I play the French horn and can play the trumpet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I am not a very keen reader because I like to be outside most of the time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I ride my bike a lot and have been youth hosteling with it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My father lives abroad and I enjoy travelling to see him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I enjoy my food (especially my French grandmother as she is an excellent cook!) </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and I have a sweet tooth but I hate the dentist. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't like my hair being brushed by someone else and I hate it long. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Finally, the one thing I really find boring is homework as I would far rather be outside or make something. </T> <BR>
