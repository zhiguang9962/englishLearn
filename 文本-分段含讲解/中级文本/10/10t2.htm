&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I sometimes wonder what my mind is like inside, often I fancy that it is like this. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I feel as if my mind goes round and round like the earth and if my lessons make me think hard it begins to spin. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In my other class it was getting all stodgy and still and lumpy and rusty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I feel as if there is a ball in my mind and it is divided into pieces ¡ª each piece stands for a different mood. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The ball turns every now and then and that's what makes me change moods. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have my learning mood, my goodlooks mood, my happy mood, my loose-end mood and my grumpy mood, my miserable mood, my thoughtful mood and my planning mood. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At the moment I am writing this I am in my thoughtful mood. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I am in my thoughtful mood I think out my maths and plan stories and poems. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When my kitten is in her thoughtful mood she thinks shall I pounce or not, and shall I go to sleep or not. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This sort of thing goes on in my own mind, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is very hard for me to put my thoughts into words. </T> <BR>
