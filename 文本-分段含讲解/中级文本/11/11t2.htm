<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: Listen, the heating's broken in my room. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When are you going to come and fix it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'll get someone right away. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: You'd better. It's freezing up there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And my room's a disgrace. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That maid's useless. I want her replaced. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: Well, I'll speak to the housekeeper about it, sir, but I'm sure ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: And that hall porter's another one. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Cheeky devil. You should get rid of him, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Doesn't know how to treat guests with respect. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And look at the money I'm paying! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: Well, I'm very sorry, sir, but George has been with us for twenty years and we've never had any complaints about him until now. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: And another thing! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What are you going to do about those foreigners in number 27? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Carrying on all night in that funny language! Shouting, they were. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It shouldn't be allowed. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: If you like, sir, I'll have a word with them and ask them to be a little more considerate. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: Yes, do that, will you, then maybe I'll get some sleep. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: I'm very sorry you've been disturbed, sir. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But are you enjoying your stay apart from that? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: Well, I don't think much of the restaurant. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I can't get a decent plate of fish and chips. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's all salad and fancy stuff. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And the service is terrible, too. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: Well, sir, I'm sure the waiters try to be as helpful as they can, but they are very busy at dinner. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: Well, you should get some more, shouldn't you? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You should be able to afford it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You're charging enough this year, aren't you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MANAGER: I'm very sorry you feel that way about it, sir. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If there's anything else I can do to make your stay here more pleasant, please don't hesitate to ask me. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ALBERT: Don't worry, I'll tell you all right! </T> <BR>
