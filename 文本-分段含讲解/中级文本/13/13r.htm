&nbsp; &nbsp;    Yesterday's drizzle did not dampen Beijingers' enthusiasm in events marking the first national dental care day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    People of all ages crowded around medical experts who answered questions about dental care, and about toothbrushes and toothpaste.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    A girl in her 20's approached the consulting desk set by the Oral Medical College of the Beijing University of Medical Sciences at the Xidan crossroad. She wanted to know if there was anything wrong with her teeth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The girl dreamed about losing all her teeth, and, worse yet, her teeth ached when she awoke every morning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    After examining her mouth, a consultant said her teeth looked all right. Sometimes, however, tension makes peoples' teeth ache. Relax, she was told. And if that does not help, get a thorough dental examination.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Young parents wanted to know how to keep their children's teeth healthy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    One by one, the doctors answered their questions and outlined the best solutions for them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    More than 500 medical specialists from 18 districts and suburban counties across the municipality as well as over 200 teachers and students from the Oral Medical College of the Beijing University of Medical Sciences took part in the sidewalk consultations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    And about 47 consulting stations were set up in major streets and the four big department stores at downtown Xidan, Wangfujing, Dongsi and the Dong'an Market.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    In addition to offering suggestions, the medical workers also brought with them some simple medical equipment for fast dental checks and toothpaste and toothbrushes for sale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Posters and propaganda blackboards were also set up in most primary and middle schools in Beijing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    "I never thought there would be so much scientific knowledge on tooth brushing," said a middle-aged man. "National Dental Care day has taught me how important it is to take care of my teeth and how to do it," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    According to information from the National Dental Diseases Prevention Group, similar activities were conducted yesterday in most of the country's provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    "A massive campaign to teach people how to care for their own teeth is the best way for China to deal with dental diseases in the face of a shortage of dental medical workers," Chen Minzhang, Minister of Public Health said on Tuesday at a symposium on dental care in Beijing Stomatological Hospital.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    At present, almost half of the population is suffering from dental caries (cavities).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    While the figure is even higher among children, 80 per cent of urban children have dental caries and 60 per cent are so afflicted in rural areas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    In some cities, the rate with children may reach as high as more than 90 per cent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The minister also pointed out that dental care should be taught in primary and middle schools and the vast rural areas in order to raise the whole nation's dental care standards.<BR>
