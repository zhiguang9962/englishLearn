&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When memory began for me, my grandfather was past sixty ¡ª a great tall man with thick hair becoming gray. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had black eyes and a straight nose which ended in a slightly flattened tip. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Once he explained seriously to me that he got that flattened tip as a small child when he fell down and stepped on his nose. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The little marks of laughter at the corners of his eyes were the product of a kindly and humorous nature. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The years of work which had bent his shoulders had never dulled his humor nor his love of a joke. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Everywhere he went, "Gramp" made friends easily. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At the end of half an hour you felt you had known him all your life. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I soon learned that he hated to give orders, but that when he had to, he tried to make his orders sound like suggestions. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One July morning, as he was leaving to go to the cornfield, he said: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Edwin, you can pick up the potatoes in the field today if you want to do that." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then he drove away with his horses. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The day passed, and I did not have any desire to pick up potatoes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Evening came and the potatoes were still in the field. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Gramp, dusty and tired, led the horses to get their drink. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How many bags of potatoes were there?" Gramp inquired. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I don't know." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How many potatoes did you pick up?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I didn't pick any." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Not any! Why not?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You said I could pick them up if I wanted to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You didn't say I had to." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In the next few minutes I learned a lesson I would not forget: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> when Gramp said I could if I wanted to, he meant that I should want to. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Gram hated cruelty and injustice. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The injustices of history, even those of a thousand years before, angered her as much as the injustices of her own day. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She also had a deep love of beauty. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she was almost seventy-five, and had gone to live with one of her daughters, she spent a delightful morning washing dishes because, as she said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the beautiful patterns on the dishes gave her pleasure. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The bird, the flowers, the clouds ¡ª all that was beautiful around her ¡ª pleased her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was like the father of the French painter, Millet, who used to gather grass and show it to his son, saying, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "See how beautiful this is!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In a pioneer society it is the harder qualities of mind and character that are of value. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The softer virtues are considered unnecessary. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Men and women struggling daily to earn a living are unable, even for a moment, to forget the business of preserving their lives. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Only unusual people, like my grandparents, manage to keep the softer qualities in a world of daily struggle. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Such were the two people with whom I spent the months from June to September in the wonderful days of summer and youth. </T> <BR>
