&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Maybe you are an average student with an average intellect. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You pass most of your subjects. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You occasionally get good grades, but they are usually just average. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You are more interested in hiking than in history, and in sports than in scholarship. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The fact is that you don't study very much. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> You probably think you will never be a top student. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is not necessarily so, however. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Anyone can become a better scholar if he or she wants to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is true that you may not be enthusiastic about everything that you study, but by using your time properly you may improve your grades without additional work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here's how: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 1. Plan your time carefully. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you plan a trip, one of the first things you must do is to make a list of things to take. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you don't you are almost certain to leave something important at home. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you plan your week, you should make a list of things that you have to do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Otherwise, you may forget to leave enough time to complete an important task. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After making the list, you should make a schedule of your time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> First fill in committed time ¡ª eating, sleeping, dressing, school, meeting, etc. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then decide on a good, regular time for studying. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Be sure to set aside enough time to complete the work that you are normally assigned each week. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course, studying shouldn't occupy all of your free time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Don't forget to set aside enough time for entertainment, hobbies, and maybe just relaxation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A weekly schedule may not solve all your problems, but it will force you to realize what is happening to your time. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 2. Find a good place to study. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Look around the house for a good study area. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Keep this space, which may be a desk or simply a corner of your room, free from everything but study materials. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No games, radios, or television! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you can't find such a place at home, find a library where you can study. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you sit down to work, concentrate on the subject! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And don't go to the place you have chosen unless you are ready to study. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 3. Scan before you read. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This means looking a passage over quickly but thoroughly before you begin to read it more carefully. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Scanning a passage lets you preview the material and get a general idea of the content. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This will actually allow you to skip less important material when you begin to read. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Scanning will help you double your reading speed and improve your comprehension. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 4. Make good use of your time in class. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Take advantage of class time to listen to everything the teacher says. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sit where you can see and hear well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Really listening in class means less work later. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Taking notes will help you remember what the teacher says. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When the teacher gets off the subject, stop taking notes. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 5. Study regularly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you get home from class, go over your notes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Review the important points that your teacher mentioned in class. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Read any related material in your textbook. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you know what your teacher is going to discuss the next day, scan and read that material, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This will help you understand the next class. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you do these things regularly, the material will become more meaningful, and you will remember it longer. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> 6. Develop a good attitude about tests. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The world won't end if you don't pass a test, so don't get overly worried. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Tests do more than just provide grades; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> they let you know what you need to study more, and they help make your new knowledge permanent. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> There are other techniques that might help you with your studying. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Only a handful have been mentioned here. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You will probably discover many others after you have tried these. </T> <BR>
