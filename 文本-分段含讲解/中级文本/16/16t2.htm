&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some kind of planning is essential. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For one thing it reveals whether you really have enough to say on the topic you have chosen while there is still time to change to another topic. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is also important because it stimulates your ideas and helps to fix them in your mind. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Without some notes to help you, you may find that you begin writing with several ideas in your head but you forget some of them as you are writing. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When you have chosen your topic, and perhaps have a general idea of your theme, make quick short notes of all the ideas that come into your head. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Remember that these should be notes ¡ª words or phrases ¡ª not sentences, which would slow you down. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As you do this you will find that new ideas will come to you, for one idea leads to another. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This should not take more than ten minutes, for in an examination you have no time to waste. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If you have not yet decided on your main theme, you can do so now, and then on the main idea of each paragraph. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You may have to rearrange your ideas, to decide which paragraphs they will fit into, and which ideas will be left out altogether. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It is for you to decide how detailed your plan should be. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you are good at writing, and have had plenty of practice, probably only a few brief notes will be necessary, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but if you are not, then you may require a more detailed plan. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But remember that even the best writers need to make some notes if they are going to produce a well-organized piece of writing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You will of course be given marks for the arrangement of your ideas. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> With your plan in front of you, you should be able to write your composition. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There should be no need to write a rough version first, then correct it and make a final copy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is a waste of time. </T> <BR>
