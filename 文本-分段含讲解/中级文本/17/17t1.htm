&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Jennifer got off the bus from the university and began walking towards the flat she shared with two other students. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On her way she had to buy some food and stopped in one of the shops in the street. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was run by an Asian family, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and although the prices there were a little higher than in the big supermarket further down the street, she did a lot of her shopping there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The vegetables were fresher and they had various things she couldn't get elsewhere. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Patel, the owner of the shop, was checking through a list, but smiled, as he always did, when he saw her come in. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She picked up a wire basket and walked towards the back of the shop, where the rice was kept. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The shop was divided by three long aisles, with rows of shelves crammed with all sorts of things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Except for her and Mr. Patel, there were only two other people there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were two teenage boys, and they were standing at the end of one of the aisles. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She glanced at them as she passed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were both wearing long, old-fashioned overcoats and they looked rather ridiculous in them because the coats were too big. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But such things were popular with some teenagers at the time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Watch out, stupid," she heard one of them whisper to the other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She walked on the next aisle and found the rice she was looking for. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then she heard something else. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It sounded like a tin dropping on the floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She peered through a gap in the shelf and caught a glimpse of one of the boys bending down. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She saw him pick up a tin of food. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But instead of putting it in the shopping basket, he dropped it into the inside pocket of his long overcoat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Jennifer glanced back down the aisle. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She could see Mr. Patel at the cash till, still checking through his list. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then she looked through the gap in the shelf again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The boys still had their backs to her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Come on, let's get out of here," she heard one of them say. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At the same time, she saw one of them put another tin in his overcoat pocket. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They moved away from her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She could no longer see what they were doing or hear what they were saying. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When she got to the till, the two boys were in front of her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She watched them pay for the few things they had in the basket. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had both buttoned their coats and fastened them with their belts. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Patel did not seem suspicious at all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He even smiled at them as they were about to leave. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Jennifer opened her mouth to say something. </T> <BR>
