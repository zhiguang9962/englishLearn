&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The only crime I have ever been connected with was unsuccessful. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One summer night I went to bed, leaving my bedroom door open because it was very hot. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> During the night I was woken up by the sound of a match being struck. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For a moment I thought it must be the friend I lived with, but then I remembered he was away. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I felt certain there was someone in the room. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I saw the outline of a man standing near the door. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was almost certain the man was a burglar. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Without thinking what I was doing, I shouted loudly and jumped out of bed to catch the man. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As I ran across the garden, I suddenly realized I was doing something very foolish. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The burglar I was chasing might be carrying a knife. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I went straight back into the house and locked all the doors to protect myself. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This was a very small crime which did not succeed, but crime is a serious problem in Britain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One sort of crime which particularly worries people is juvenile delinquency ¡ª </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> that is, crimes committed by young people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For some years, juvenile delinquency has been increasing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are two main sorts of juvenile crime: stealing and violence. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Most people do not understand why young people commit these crimes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are, I think, a large number of different reasons. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These crimes are not usually committed by people who are poor or in need. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Young people often dislike and resent the adult world. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They will do things to show that they are rebels. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Also in Britain today it is easier for young people to commit crimes because they have more freedom to go where they like and more money to do what they like. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> There are two other possible causes which are worth mentioning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> More and more people in Britain live in large towns. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In a large town no one knows who anyone else is or where they live. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But in the village I come from crimes are rare because everybody knows everyone else. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Although it is difficult to explain, I think the last cause is very important. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps there is something wrong with our society which encourages violence and crime. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is a fact that all the time children are exposed to films and reports about crime and violence. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many people do not agree that this influences young people, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but I think that young people are very much influenced by the society they grow up in. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I feel that the fault may be as much with our whole society as with these young people. </T> <BR>
