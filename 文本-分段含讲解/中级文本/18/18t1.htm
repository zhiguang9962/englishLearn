&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Ten years ago I used to be very fit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I cycled to work and I got a lot of exercise at the weekends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I used to play tennis a lot and go for long walks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In those days I didn't earn very much. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I had a job in an office. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It wasn't a very good job but I had a lot of time to do the things I enjoyed doing. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Then, about eight years ago, I got a much better job. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The pay was better. But the hours were a lot longer, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I bought a car and drove to work every day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I began to take people out to lunch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Expense account" lunches. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I began to put on weight, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I stopped playing tennis and going for long walks at the weekend because I just didn't have any time for things like that any more. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There's a lot of stress in a job like mine. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps that's why I started drinking more than I used to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For example, I used to have only half a glass of whisky when I got home, then I started filling the glass to the top. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then I had another glass, and then another. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I started smoking a lot, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I never used to smoke at all. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Two months ago I had a heart attack. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At first I just couldn't believe it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I'm too young," I said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Luckily it wasn't very serious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was in hospital a few days and they did a lot of tests. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The doctor advised me to stop smoking and to eat less. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He told me to do a lot of other things, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I don't see how I can do some of them and keep my job. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For example, he advised me to work less, and get more exercise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I just haven't any time! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My job takes everything out of me! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Sometimes I wonder if I should get another job. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps I could do something like I used to do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But if I do that, I won't earn as much. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have a family to support. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have to think of them, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I just don't know what I should do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What do you think? </T> <BR>
