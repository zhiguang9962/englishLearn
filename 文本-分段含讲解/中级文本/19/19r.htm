&nbsp; &nbsp;    I am beginning to feel the pressure of work. None of the courses are as simple as they appear to be. There are a lot of reference books to consult and you can consider yourself lucky if you manage to get half of them from the library. Most copies seem to be permanently lent out. The reading rooms are always crowded and you have to get there early in order to find a place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The biggest headache is our dormitory. Though there are desks for us to work at, nobody ever works there. For one thing, the room is so crowded that there is little elbow room, and it is so dark that we need the electric light even in day time. The worst is the human element ¡ª there are always those who don't want to work and won't let others work either. They either chat, sing, play the guitar or listen to tapes. How I miss my little cubicle of a room at home!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    Perhaps it's only a reaction against my early excitement, but anyway I am often overcome by low spirits. Sometimes I even think I am wasting my time here and wish I had not come here at all. But of course I know they are only passing moods caused by my disillusionment. I find some of the teachers just hopeless and totally irresponsible. All they are interested in is to earn some extra money by moonlighting. In one way they are to be sympathized with because they do need the extra money what with their low salaries and the rising prices. But surely they shouldn't let us suffer as a result.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    My biggest disappointment is in my fellow students. Of course I am referring only to some, and perhaps they are only a minority. They are a far cry from my old image of college students. They dress and behave no better than the hooligans we often see in the streets. I really don't know how they managed to get into the university, for they don't seem to be interested in their studies at all. All they care for is to have a good time, as though to enter university is an end in itself. They hold dances every Saturday evening or play cards in the dormitories deep into the night, drinking and smoking heavily. What's more they always jump the queue in the dining halls and quarrel with anyone who tries to stop them. Once they even came to blows. What a disgrace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    But despite all this, college life is opening up for me a new vista that brings as much excitement as enlightenment. Here we can talk about anything under the sun. I had always thought myself well-read and my classmates at school had looked up to me for my wide "general knowledge". But now I've come to realize how ignorant I really am. Just from casual conversations and informal discussions, I've learnt more about the world and society in the past two months than what I learned from all the formal classes at school. Also I found many extra-curricula lectures by guest speakers most stimulating. One in particular inspired me very much, a lecture on symphonic music by a young conductor from the Central Conservatory. Before, music used to be merely a collection of beautiful sounds to me. But now I am constantly discovering new and hidden meaning behind all these sounds.ª¥<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    One thing I am sure: college life is and will be a most colourful and fruitful period in my whole life.<BR>
