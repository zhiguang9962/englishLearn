<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: What's on the telly this evening£¿I feel like relaxing. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Why ask me that? You know I never watch it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: Too busy with the latest hobby, are you? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What is it this time, knitting socks for your nephews? Or collecting buttons? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wish I had as much free time as you do. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Men! As a matter of fact, you probably have more than I do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But you waste it all watching your telly. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: That's not a waste of time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've got to rest sometimes. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Sometimes, maybe, but not all the time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And anyway, I relax with my hobbies. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A change is as good as a rest. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: Well, the telly's my hobby, and I learn a lot from it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: But it doesn't teach you to do anything, does it? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You just sit there and stare at it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's not learning. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: But I do learn. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are lots of educational programmes. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: But you don't watch them, do you? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Whenever an educational programme comes on, you either switch over to the other channel or go to sleep. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: When I come home from work, I need to put my feet up, at least for a while. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Life's not all work, you know. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Hobbies aren't work, Jeff. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I like putting my feet up, too, at the end of the day, but I like doing things while I rest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Life's too short for us to waste time. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: Mary dear, as I've said many times, we're different. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are two kinds of people in the world ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: I know, I know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Those who are never happy unless they're running about doing things ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: That's right, and those who are never happy unless they're doing nothing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm one of the latter and you ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: I know, dear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm one of the former. And proud of it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: So now we agree. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Live, and let live. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You can go peacefully back to your button collection, and I can watch TV. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: If only you organised yourself better, there's so much you could do, really. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You're wasting your talents. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And one last thing: I'm not collecting buttons. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEFF: What are you doing then? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Making sculptures from potatoes? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: No, I'm learning how to make Turkish cakes, and the first ones came out very well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course, if you're too tired, I won't insist on you trying them. </T> <BR>
