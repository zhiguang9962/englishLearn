&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After ignoring family planning policies and siring three girls, Zhang, who lives in a village in Henan Province, finally got the son he was waiting for this year. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Despite the heavy fines exacted for breaking the regulations on family planning, Zhang was overjoyed. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The honest and simple peasant does not hesitate when asked why he so much desired a son. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Why? Who'll support me when I get old?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Actually there are some homes for old folks in the village and nearby. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But though he supposes they live well there, Zhang still does not believe the old folks are happy. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "It's just so-so there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who knows what it'll be like over there when I get old. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's better to have a son," Zhang said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And a son-in-law cannot be depended on to support him, says Zhang. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A son-in-law who lives with his wife's family is looked down on by the community. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He cannot be expected to replace a natural son. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A family nearby has four sons. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Life became very hard when the two older sons got married. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> However, the third son says he would rather be a bachelor for life than risk having to take in some day his wife's aged parents. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As China's family planning programme enters the 1990s, traditional ideas on family life are posing the major barriers to limiting China's population. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These ideas have formed over thousands of years. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The concept of "more sons, more happiness" still exists in some rural areas, especially in poor and remote ones. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For some families, the presence of several sons gives parents a feeling of protection. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Families with no boys, or few boys, may feel intimidated by families with many sons. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Another problem the country must face is early marriages. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A survey in a town in Zhecheng County shows young people marrying earlier than the law prescribes. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some are engaged by the age of 15. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Parents dream of grandchildren, and sometimes they encourage early marriages, ignoring the government's call for "marriage at mature ages". </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Changing these ideas is hard as tens of millions of peasants are illiterate. </T> <BR>
