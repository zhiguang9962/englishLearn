MIRIAM: Yeah, when, when did you start smoking? <BR>
STEVE: Well, I started when I was, er, about sixteen, and I really started because I...well, I think my family smoked and that really made me want to, er, ... really; somehow it was like growing up.<BR>
MIRIAM: Yeah.<BR>
STEVE: And, of course, my friends around me were smoking and when we, when we left school we'd go over the park and have a s..., and have a quick cigarette. And er, I mean, I do remember when I first started that I didn't really draw cigarettes at all because I didn't really know how to do it and I didn't think it was very pleasant; and it's only as time goes by you get more and more involved in that, erm, in that process until finally you've ... you realise that you, you can't give up. And, in fact, when I first started I used to pretend that I was so hooked that I couldn't give up, because it was like being a child£­it was like being a, being a grown-up. You know, grown-ups say they can't give up smoking, they wish they couldn't smoke and I used to pretend to say that. And of course, by the time it really happens it's too late. It doesn't mean the same thing any more. You actually want to give up but you can't.<BR>
MIRIAM: I've smoked since I was eighteen and I started, er.. as you did, sort of ... sort of socially. And it wasn't a lot of fun to start with. <BR>
STEVE: Right.<BR>
MIRIAM: It was quite embarrassing, sometimes, you know. You get smoke in your eyes and your eyes would water and it's a dead give-away that you've only just started.<BR>
STEVE: Mmm.<BR>
MIRIAM: Er. And I didn't care for the taste all that much but everybody ... people smoked...I mean I started smoking a long time ago before anything was known about cancer and, er... it was just the thing to do. And as, as you said, it was a ..., it was being grown-up. It was drawing that line, you know: I am, now grown up.<BR>
ANNE: I should think I started at nine ... I started. No, I really started my first year at university. Everybody else smoked. It was just the thing to do. And now not so many people smoke, it's ... it seems to me that it was an awful waste of time and money. But my father smoked and my mother didn't so it was always a split thing in the house. I don't know, I really ... I think it probably just was a social habit more than anything else. <BR>
JOHN: Like most people, I started smoking at school, foolishly. Er, I was offered cigarettes by other, er, children and in those days, I suppose smoking was the equivalent of drug taking today; er, that it was considered, erm, ... erm, ... fashionable and sophisticated and adult to smoke.<BR>
