&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Few people like changing their habits, good or bad, and, whether it is smoking, drinking or over-eating, they continue "enjoying" them to the end, often the bitter end. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On every packet of cigarettes and in every advertisement, Americans are warned against the dangers of smoking: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In spite of this, millions of them start smoking or go on smoking. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One reason may be that people watch their "heroes" on TV drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and fighting their way from adventure to adventure, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "heroes" who seem to fear nothing, neither killing other people nor killing themselves with alcohol and cigarettes. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If they are not afraid of the effects of smoking and drinking alcohol, why should John Smith, sitting at home in his armchair watching all this, be afraid? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The simple warning on the cigarette packet does not influence his "hero's" habits either. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But even stronger warnings, like showing pictures of smokers who have lost a leg or died of cancer, seem to have no effect on people's smoking habits. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Knowing and believing seem to be two different things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The young girl smoking a cigarette in the advertisement runs the risk of dying of cancer in a few years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The smoker sitting next to you may have a heart attack next week. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But don't worry! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The chance of dying in an accident is just as great. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Particularly if enough people agree with one advertiser that driving a car at 212 m.p.h. and smoking interesting cigarettes is all that life is really about. </T> <BR>
