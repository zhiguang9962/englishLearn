&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Vietnam? Isn't that a shame? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN>  I saw a film on Vietnam, it showed the actual fighting. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It looked ridiculous, just a bunch of kids. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was actually embarrassing to watch that, people were actually shooting and shouting. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I saw Vietnam. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I looked at a map once. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm concerned with Vietnam if my brother has to go, otherwise, no. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My interest in life is me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's a shame. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wish I could pick up a newspaper and read it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What I hear about things is heard from other people. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I hope I'll make it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think it's marriage, to someone who is successful. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Highland Park, a couple of kids. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm not too crazy about children, though. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You're sitting in a room, and all of a sudden five kids'll come in and they'll go to another girl in the room. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Same with dogs. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'm worried about the next couple of years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here I'm putting all this time and feeling into this relationship with Steven, and to have it not work out, it would be terrible. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't know what I'd do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'd probably find someone else and be just as happy. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We have to have war, there's been wars through all the ages, apparently everyone gets enjoyment out of it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If we removed this part from man, it would be boring. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Otherwise things would be sort of dull. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I love my building, I just love it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If I'm on a bus going to my mother's, I look at these people and get a nauseous feeling. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> On Michigan Avenue, I respect them more. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Home gives me a sick feeling. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It's a shame Blacks don't like me and children don't like me and dogs don't run up to me. </T> <BR>
