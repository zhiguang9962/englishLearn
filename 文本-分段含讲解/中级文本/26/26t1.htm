&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I had a most exasperating and frustrating experience with the hospital today. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But Granny had it much worse. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> First she was the victim of an accident and then she was the suffering patient. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She was out shopping early this morning, and was hardly a few scores of yards from our house when she was knocked down by a bicycle. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The rider was a reckless young man who didn't even stop after the accident, but raced away as though an army was after him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was a neighbour who recognized her and came to call me (both of my parents were out). </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I heard the news, my heart jumped up to my mouth. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I raced downstairs, two or three steps at a time and sprinted to the spot. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I never ran so fast in my life. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There I saw a crowd of people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I elbowed my way in, and saw Granny sitting on the ground leaning against a tree, her face all swollen and her mouth bleeding. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was holding her left arm with her right hand. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It must be a fracture judging from the way it hurt her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some of the crowd were concerned and offering help and advice, but most were just curious onlookers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Someone managed to stop a passing car for us, and the driver kindly drove us to the nearest hospital. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then our ordeal began. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Naturally I took her to the emergency room first and expected immediate attention. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But we had to wait for at least ten minutes before a doctor came over to us. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He just took a brief look at her and said simply: "Go to the dental department." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "But doctor, aren't you going to give her a thorough check?" I asked. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Don't worry, her life is not in danger." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Before I could say anything more, he was already out of sight. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> There was nothing for us to do but look for the dental department which took us a long time because it was on the third floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There the dentist told us that we must register first, so I had to rush all the way down again to the ground floor, there only to find a long queue. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I tried to jump the queue explaining it was an emergency case, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Go to the emergency room if it's an emergency case!" </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Anyway I stood obediently at the end of the line and at last when my turn came I was given many forms to fill, some of which were very detailed and quite unnecessary I thought. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After filling them I found I had to queue up once again to hand them in! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> By the time everything was finished and I rushed upstairs, I was happy to find the dentist had the decency not to wait for me before treating Granny. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That was the first comforting thing after entering the hospital and I really felt grateful to the dentist. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After putting several stitches to lips and gum, the dentist said: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "That's all. Now go and pay your bill." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But doctor, her arm hurts." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You have to go to the surgical department for that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's just opposite. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'll take you there." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I really like the man. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But all the same I had to run all the way down to the ground floor to register again for the surgical department. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And for all that much trouble the doctor spent less than five minutes examining Granny and said: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "She'll need an X-ray." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He wrote out a chit and that was that. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The X-ray department was on the ground floor and I had to help her all the way down. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The complications and rigmarole involved in getting the X-ray done were too complicated and irritating to describe. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The long and short of it was, after we got the X-ray picture, I had to take Granny all the way up again to the third floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After taking a look at it, the doctor said: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "No bones broken. I'll prescribe some pain-killer and antibiotics." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> So it was all the way down again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The complications in paying the bill and getting the medicine were too silly for words. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I had to queue from window to window ¡ª to get the medicine priced and added up, to pay the bill, to get the medicine ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And if you didn't know the right order and sequence, which I didn't, </T> 
<T TYPE=SEN> it often meant standing in the wrong queue only to be told to come back again after queuing up at another window. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> By the time we got home it was almost one o'clock. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We had spent almost four hours at the hospital, and I made a calculation: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Five minutes with the doctor in the emergency room, half an hour with the dentist, ten minutes with the surgeon ¡ª three quarters of an hour all told. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The rest of the time was spent waiting, queuing, rushing from place to place. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If Granny had had to do all that by herself, she wouldn't have left the hospital alive, I'm sure. </T> <BR>
