&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dr. Ding Ping, a bone specialist in No.2 People's Hospital of Anqing in Anhui Province, won a bronze medal at the 37th International Eureka Fair in Brussels last year for his invention, a new bone-setting device. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Not only the doctor himself was happy and honoured, his hospital, indeed the whole city felt honoured and happy too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But who would have thought that his invention not only brought the doctor a bronze medal, but also plunged him into a heavy debt. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It all started in 1986 when for the whole year Dr. Ding spent his every spare minute on his new invention. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After another year's clinical trial use, the device proved to be effective. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So in June last year Dr. Ding was informed by the Science Commission of Anhui Province that this invention had been selected to compete in the 37th Eureka International Fair. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> This was indeed happy news, but Dr. Ding's happiness was marred by the fact that he had to pay 5,000 <I>yuan</I> for entering his item for the fair. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Where on earth was he to raise such a huge sum? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He applied for aid from the Municipal Science Commission, but got turned down because firstly the Commission thought his invention was a private one, the work of an individual and therefore could not be funded by the public, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and secondly the Commission was hard up anyway and could not afford to pay out such a large sum. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So what was to be done? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At the last moment his hospital came to the rescue: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They agreed to lend Dr. Ding 5,000 <I>yuan,</I> but starting from January this year, they would deduct 50 <I>yuan</I> from his monthly salary until the debt was fully repaid. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dr. Ding was grateful and jumped at the chance. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But he was under no illusion about the predicament he was plunging himself into. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His salary was only 97 <I>yuan</I> a month. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His wife, a school teacher, only brought home 82 <I>yuan</I> a month. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> With two daughters at school their life was not easy as it was. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> To have 50 <I>yuan</I> deducted monthly from their meagre income for the next eight years would mean a financial burden that would surely break the camel's back. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Discarding all face problems, Dr. Ding started to beg for alms from all quarters. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mostly he met with rebuffs, but he could not afford to give up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After a few months of begging from door to door, he managed to collect 1,400 <I>yuan.</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Quite a substantial sum, but he was still 3,600 <I>yuan</I> short. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The news that his invention had won a bronze medal not only brought some spiritual comfort, but also some material gains. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His hospital decided to award him 500 <I>yuan</I> as a token of recognition for his brilliant work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the fact remains that he still had a debt to pay, now reduced to 3,100 <I>yuan.</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Again he applied for help from various municipal departments, but so far without success. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Is Dr. Ding and his family going to spend the next five years in poverty and misery just because he has invented something useful and won international recognition? </T> <BR>
