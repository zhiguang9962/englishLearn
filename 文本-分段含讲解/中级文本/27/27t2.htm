&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Having a special day in honour of teachers is a fine thing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But one day a year is not enough! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Where would the world be without teachers? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What hope would there be for human progress? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Teachers deserve the respect of the whole of society the whole year round. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But they haven't got it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What is most remarkable and regrettable is that in this great land of China, with its ancient civilization and traditional respect for learning, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> teachers are so looked down upon that it is necessary to set aside a day to show respect for them. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Why is this? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I believe that teachers' low social status is inseparable from their low pay, and poor living and working conditions ¡ª though these are gradually being improved. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But still the state allocation of funds for education is, <I>per capita,</I> among the lowest in the world. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So teachers are, in general, under-paid and overworked ¡ª especially those in pre-school, primary and secondary education. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This despite the fact that Comrade Deng Xiaoping immediately on resuming office pointed out: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> education is a continuous process and the pay and conditions of teachers from the most elementary level must be improved. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This statement was most encouraging, but progress since it was made, some years ago, has been painfully slow. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> So today, who wants to become a teacher? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who wants to marry a teacher? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When far better prospects are offered in other professions? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> True, "man does not live by bread alone" ¡ª but he can't live without it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Of course many fine dedicated people are still willing, even eager to become and remain teachers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many, but not enough. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's one reason why there are middle school classes of 70 and more pupils, an intolerable situation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The lower the number of students in a class, the higher the quality of education can be. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of course I am not speaking personally. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Looking back on 35 years as a teacher in China I feel grateful. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As a teacher here I have had a happy and rewarding life. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Being surrounded by young people has helped to keep me young. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But my pay and conditions are well above those of my Chinese colleagues. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A big and rapid improvement in their social status, together with a similar improvement in their pay, working conditions and housing, will attract more and more fine people to the teaching profession. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That is a vital and urgent necessity for China's socialist modernization. </T> <BR>
