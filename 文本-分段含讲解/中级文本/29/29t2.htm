&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I am a member of a small, nearly extinct minority group who insist, even though it seems to be out of date, on the sanctity of being on time. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Which is to say that we On-timers are compulsively, unfashionably prompt, that there are only handfuls of us left, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and, unfortunately, we never seem to have appointments with each other. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The fact is that being on time has become a social mistake. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The fact is that generally speaking, the time that the Late-people set as the Moment of Rendezvous is a code. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is a code meaning at least one half-hour later. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The fact is that we On-timers can't get that into our heads. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We arrive invariably at the appointed hour at people's houses, which means that we have occasionally eaten all the sandwiches before the other guests arrive. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Which means that we are rude. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Let me explain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We are, for example, invited for dinner at eight o'clock at the home of friends who live exactly twenty minutes away. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We leave our house at ten to eight so that for once we will be a comfortable ten minutes late. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then even the traffic defeats us. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We meet only green lights and arrive at four minutes to eight. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We drive about for a while and then enter at one minute past, to the astonishment of the host and hostess. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She is at an important stage of preparation with the saucepans. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is thinking about taking a shower. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We end up helping with the first course and putting the baby to bed and mixing the drinks </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and are still left with enough time to analyse what kind of people our hosts are from the magazines on the coffee table. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As for meeting in restaurants, you can immediately recognise us On-timers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We are the only non-alcoholics standing in restaurant doorways in December. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If not, we can always be found killing time in the cloakroom or trying to look as if we are not alone at the bar. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Now, we all know that these very same Late-people do not routinely miss planes or the beginnings of films. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But, as I told a Late-person recently, "If I were a train, I'd be gone ... " </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> With regard to meetings there are two kinds of people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Those who hate to wait and those who hate to make others wait. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The sadists and the masochists? I hope not. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> There was a New York magazine piece once about the power struggle involved in business lunches. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It intimated that you could always tell the powerless and the powerful. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Indians were waiting, while the Chiefs arrived half an hour or an hour later. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you are an On-timer, you cannot make an entrance. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The Late-people, of course, are always terribly sorry, "but something important came up" (in contrast to us, for instance). </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Besides, as they say, their minds are always so full of big questions (like The Bomb) that they never know what time it is. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In comparison with the On-timers, they suggest, who have their little brains filled with stupid details like the big hand and the little hand on the clock. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The problem is getting worse. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you adjust to the Late-people and accept the fact that they're half an hour behind the time you arranged to meet, they arrive an hour late. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Fewer and fewer of us On-timers remain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We are now surprised when anyone else is on time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We have begun to make certain adjustments like setting our clocks and watches back or bringing the novel we're working on to dinner parties. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> How late we are to recognise that being on time is out of date, that in fact, our time has passed. </T> <BR>
