<P align=center>From the court notes of a local reporter</P><BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In court at 9 o'clock. Apart from me there are a few old ladies who have come to sit in the warm and a class of 14-15 year-olds with their teacher.<BR>
9:05<BR>
Court starts. First case: Henry P., 47, divorced, charged with being drunk. He refused to leave a pub at closing time and caused a bit of damage when the police tried to arrest him. P. said he had had an argument with his boss and could not face going home to an empty flat. <BR>

Mrs. F., 72, shoplifting. Apparently Mrs. F. had stolen a frozen chicken, which she had hidden under her hat (At this the school children burst out laughing and even the magistrates have difficulty keeping a straight face). The chicken was so cold that she fell unconscious, otherwise she would probably not have been caught. Mrs. F, in tears, says she had not eaten meat for three weeks. It turns out that, although she has the old-age pension, she does not know about other forms of support.<BR>
9:40<BR>
James S., 42, a teacher, charged with beating his wife and two young children. Mrs. S. is in hospital in bad shape; the mother-in-law is taking care of the children. The neighbours sent for the police ¡ª one case, thank heavens, where neighbours did not "mind their own business". Mrs. S. had already run away twice, but S. had promised to change and she had gone home again. S. said that he was ashamed of what he had done, but that he often lost his temper with his wife, who was quarrelsome and had no sense of duty. The school children looked thoughtful; they probably thought that teachers do not do that sort of thing.<BR>
10:30<BR>
Peter D., 19. D. stole, or rather "borrowed" a motorcycle, intending, he said, to give it back to the owner after trying it out. D.'s father is at sea and the mother is left to bring up four children, of whom Peter is the eldest, by herself.<BR>
11:00<BR>
Mrs. A., 45, a doctor's wife, president of a local ladies' club, was caught leaving a fashion shop wearing two dresses, only one of which belonged to her. Admitting that she had wanted to steal the dress, she could not explain why.<BR>
