&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Inspector Chester of Scotland Yard soon arrived on the scene of the crime. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When the newspapermen saw him getting out of the car they immediately realised that matters were serious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Inspector Chester had a fine reputation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had solved many difficult and complicated crimes during the last few years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Most of them were robberies. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This one concerned the theft of jewels belonging to a famous film actress. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was reputed to be a millionairess. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So it was not surprising that the missing jewels were valued at a quarter of a million pounds. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The newspapermen were eager to question the detective. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He stood on the pavement outside the house and smiled at the photographers. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Have you a statement to make?" somebody asked. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The detective ¡ª tall, thick-set, middle-aged, clean-shaven ¡ª </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> pushed his way through the crowd, climbed a few steps to the front door, turned round and said in a cool, clear voice: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I have no statement to make. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As soon as there is anything fresh to tell you, I'll let you know." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He beckoned to a policeman, whispered a few words in his ear and went into the house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After a "Move along, please" from the policeman, the crowd gradually dispersed. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Upstairs, Inspector Chester walked over to the French windows. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was probably through these that the thieves had come. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had left no clues, no finger-prints. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It had apparently not been difficult for them to break into the safe. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just as the detective was about to examine this once again, the telephone rang. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Hullo, Inspector", a soft, monotonous voice said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "If you want a clue, why don't you talk to the servant? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The one with a small scar on the right cheek." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Was this a trick? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Would it put the Inspector on the right track? </T> <BR>
