&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Inspector Robinson was swearing aloud when he arrived at the fine, old house at the top of the hill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The past few weeks had been rough for him, and it looked as if there was more trouble ahead. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was raining hard, and Carruthers, his assistant, who was waiting for him at the gate, was wet to the skin. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As they walked up the path together, Carruthers explained what had happened. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The woman, Sylvia Fortagne, a daughter of Lord Arthrington, had been found dead in the sitting-room by one of the servants that evening. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The police doctor, who had examined the body, was sure that it was a clear case of poisoning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had not moved the body; it still lay face upwards, where it had fallen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Underneath her body they had found the photograph of an unknown young man. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There had been no signs of a struggle. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The woman's husband had not been seen since lunchtime. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> According to the cook he had left the house "in anger", as she put it, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> after a quarrel with his wife, and had gone for a ride on one of his favourite horses. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Carruthers pushed open the front door, and the two men entered the hall. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Inspector Robinson took off his hat and went into the sitting-room. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> ！ We'll have to wait, said Carruthers wiping his glasses. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> ！ It's no use waiting, said the Inspector. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't think he'll dare to come back. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's pretty obvious he did it. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Saying this, he put on his hat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were about to leave the house when they saw a dark figure approaching them from out of the shadows. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was Nigel Fortagne. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>Nigel Fortagne's story </I></T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> ！ Yes, it's true that I knew that my wife was in love with another man, but I trusted her and believed that she would forget about him sooner or later. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But when she returned from a weekend in Paris this morning, she told me that she wanted a divorce and threatened to do something terrible if I didn't agree to it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I refused, of course. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She drank heavily at lunchtime and even opened the bottle which she had brought as a present for me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She insisted that I should join her for a drink, but I didn't, because I had taken my medicine. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm not supposed to take it with alcohol. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suffer from a weak heart, you see. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was in a terrible state, so I put some of my pills into my glass when she wasn't looking. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then I exchanged the glasses. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was not really much, but, of course, I should have known how dangerous these pills can be. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But at that moment I was so angry that I didn't care. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was sick and tired of the argument and left the house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was so drunk she wouldn't have noticed any difference in the taste of the sherry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I came back to see how she was. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And, besides, there's no point in running away, because life doesn't mean anything to me without her. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>James Highsmith's story </I></T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Afterwards, James Highsmith, the young man in the photograph, was questioned by Inspector Robinson. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When he was told what had happened he broke down. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> ！ Yes, I'm not ashamed to admit that we were in love. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We had a wonderful time in Paris, but I was afraid of losing her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sylvia often talked about killing him because he would never agree to a divorce. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I begged her not to do it, but she said that one of us had to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then I found one of his prescriptions in her hand-bag. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I bought the medicine, put some of it into a bottle of sherry and told Sylvia to give it to him as a present. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was him or me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wasn't anxious about her drinking from the bottle because I was fairly sure that it wasn't really enough to kill a normal, healthy grown-up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I must have killed her, though, and the only comfort I can find in her death is that I don't have to share her with him any longer. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>Sylvia Fortagne's story </I></T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> James Highsmith did not know that the police had found a message on a slip of paper in Sylvia Fortagne's hand-bag. </T> <BR>
<BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>Dear James,</I> </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Please forgive me for the terrible thing I am going to do, but it's the only way out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have considered everything carefully, and I know it's very selfish, but W. has destroyed my life and made me thoroughly unhappy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you receive this letter he will have been found dead after a heart attack with a glass of sherry in his hand. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I tried to phone you earlier this morning, but couldn't reach you. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In case they examine the body they will think that he took an overdose of his medicine by mistake. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His family will come over to comfort me and will probably stay for a few weeks, so, please, don't try to get in touch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It will all be worth it in the end. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> All my love, </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Yours ever, </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> S. </T> <BR>
