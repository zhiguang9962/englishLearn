&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike some of the animals you've read about, most human beings are not colourblind. In fact, there is some evidence that our colour preferences are influenced by our characters or the way we feel. Try the following colour test on yourself and a friend.<BR>
<B>(a) First choose your favourite colour(s) from those listed below.</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dark blue &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue-green &nbsp; &nbsp; Red &nbsp; &nbsp; Yellow &nbsp; &nbsp; Violet &nbsp; &nbsp; Brown<BR>
<B>(b) Now read the following comments and decide if they are correct as they apply to you.</B><BR>
<I>Dark blue</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you choose this colour it means that you feel you need peace and quiet at the moment. Maybe you've been working hard and need to relax. You like calm, problem-free relationships with others and an orderly environment.<BR>
<I>Blue-green</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You have a strong will. When you decide to do something, you don't change your mind easily. You don't like to fail in what you do. Because of your determination to do a job well, you must be careful of tension which can cause stomach upsets. So make sure you get enough physical exercise to give yourself time to relax!<BR>
<I>Red</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; People who like red enjoy life, and like to achieve results. You probably like sports and good food. In fact, you are active and energetic and would make a good leader. Be careful not to overdo things and make sure you relax by following restful interests such as listening to music, reading, etc. This will give your life a balance between activity and relaxation.<BR>
<I>Yellow</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You are an open, cheerful and friendly person and you enjoy change. You are energetic but in fits and starts; a few days of hard work followed by a less energetic period, and then more hard work again. Your energies are often directed towards the future; you want to modernise and improve the present.<BR>
<I>Violet</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You are charming and very sensitive. People may find you fascinating and a little mysterious. You enjoy literature and music and have a tendency to live in a "dream world" ¡ª and then feel disappointed when you see reality!<BR>
<I>Brown</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Brown is the colour of the earth and nature. People who favour brown have often had a few problems recently which have made them feel some discomfort. Has this happened to you? If so, you may feel you need a quiet and comfortable environment, surrounded by nature.<BR>
