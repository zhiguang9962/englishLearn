&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You really are a lucky dog." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many people assume that admission into the Institute of Foreign Trade means not only a farewell to "unemployment", but also a hearty handshake with affluence. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They say, and I quote, "As soon as you graduate, you will have a fair chance to go abroad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You may fly round the world, see exciting things and exotic places and feel as happy as a lark and as proud as a peacock." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I didn't know what to think when I first came to this institute. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Happy? Yes, happy that I had been admitted by this splendid institute of higher learning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I started to dream about the many things I had so excitedly heard from those who like to dream. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I fancied myself posted to one of our commercial offices overseas, working in carpeted offices with air-conditioning, and delightful social activities and parties in the evenings. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "What would you like, tea or coffee?" </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I would answer with a nod, "Brazilian coffee with Danish milk please." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And trying to make conversation, I would say, "What lovely Mediterranean weather we are having!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Sometimes, however, I felt a bit uneasy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Comfort is not the only thing in life, you know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I do care about what people may think of me, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> particularly those "scholarly" people who might turn up their noses at the mere mention of the word "trade" and frown at me, taking me for a little money-grubbing, vulgar merchant. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Well, a year at this institute has taught me a great many things. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> First, it is not at all easy to be trained for the foreign trade service. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Like the students of all other institutes, you must work hard, be straight in all your dealings, staunchly patriotic, loyal and 100% reliable. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You must get a good command of two foreign languages and Chinese, and try in every way to broaden the range and scope of your knowledge, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> which you may have to draw upon in your future work ¡ª history, geography, culture and so on and so forth. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Let me cite one or two examples to show how important it is to know the customs and culture of different countries. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Once, one of our corporations wanted to sell washing machines to Arab countries. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In an advertisement to promote sales, strategy demands diagrams instead of written instructions. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Dirty clothes went into the machine in the first diagram, a thorough washing was illustrated in the third. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Simple and clear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the result was disastrous. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Arabic is written from right to left. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How can this corporation expect to promote sales with dirty clothes as a result of the new machine? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Another example concerns trade-marks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of the best batteries produced in China is the "White Elephant" battery. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In English, however, "White Elephant" means an object that is useless, overpriced and utterly undesirable. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you think English-speaking people would be inclined to make a large purchase of this "White Elephant"? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Second, I've come to learn that the life of a foreign trade worker is not exactly what most people think it is. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A good foreign trade worker is one who is dedicated to his work. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He must have a strong sense of duty and be fully aware that a slight mistake may bring colossal losses to the country both politically and economically. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My uncle, for instance, happens to be a foreign trade worker. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Since he is very busy, my aunt has to do nearly all the housework. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is often disturbed in his sleep because of the heavy responsibility. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sometimes, he goes to dinner parties four times a week, or even twice a day, but his duties as a translator prevent him from partaking in these banquets. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've seen many of his colleagues burning the candle at both ends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They seldom go to theatres. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They seldom go to concerts and they can't even afford time to watch a football match which they're very much interested in. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They always think of the interests of the people and the country, without a single thought for themselves. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So, think of the tasks, think of the responsibility. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Shame on those who only think of their personal comfort, of going abroad, drinking toasts and coming back loaded with foreign made articles. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Last, but not least, I've come to learn that foreign trade plays a substantial role in our national economy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is done by acquiring from abroad the equipment and technical know-how necessary for our modernization drive and by pushing the sales of our exports which form the material basis of our imports. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are so many new fields to open up and so many new things to be learned. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Four or five years is not enough. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It requires more than one's lifetime. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As a student of foreign trade, I feel that my future job is just as significant and necessary as many other occupations, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> like the geologists' conquering the deserts, the scientists' tapping the ocean, and the astronauts' exploring the outer space. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Instead of going abroad, I may be asked to sit at my desk all my life, collecting data, translating or interpreting. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then, "Am I a lucky dog?" Yes. I am lucky that I've become a student of foreign trade. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Lucky that I'm conscious of the responsibility of a business woman of New China. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Lucky that I have acquired an initial ability to serve my country and my people heart and soul. </T> <BR>
