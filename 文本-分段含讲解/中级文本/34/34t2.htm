<T TYPE=SEN> MATTHEW: Chris, why is it that there are so many different languages, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and that in Europe certainly if you travel more than a hundred miles, you're likely to find people speaking a completely different language to your own? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: Well, it's true to say that there are er ... hundreds and hundreds of different languages. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's perhaps um ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> however, more interesting and more informative to say that there are several different groups of languages er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Most European languages, with the exception of I think Finnish and er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Basque and ... Hungarian I believe, belong to the Indo-European group of languages, um ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm not very sure myself of the ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the actual details of the history of these languages, but you can be very sure that er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> that most of these languages, say Latin and Greek and our own language and er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> German and er ... French and ... all the others, are connected. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The reason why you can travel from one Willage to another in Switzerland and er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> from one area to another in England and find different dialects, if not different languages spoken, is that um ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> several hundred years ago communication was by word of mouth. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Word of mouth meant that people had to move; if people were to move they needed roads and there were no roads. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MATTHEW: Do you see any chance for a universal language like Esperanto? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHRIS: Not for an artificial er ... language, no ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suppose the Roman Catholic Church used Latin, but Latin had a ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> a particular religious basis and this is probably why it was therefore chosen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't see very much chance for Esperanto; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think it's an awfully good idea but I don't believe that language works like that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think people will probably er ... work towards the most convenient language to use. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They will not set out to learn a new language. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It seems to me that er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> either English, Russian or Chinese, perhaps Japanese, will be the language of the future er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My bet's on English. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MATTHEW: Maggie, why do you think it is that so few English people speak a second language? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAGGIE: I think when you learn a language at school ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> it tends to be rather a dead occupation, and it's very difficult to stimulate any interest among school children. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you actually go to the country and spend say a month in ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> in an exchange visit when you're a schoolgirl, or a schoolboy </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> um ... then you suddenly become more interested because you ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> you want to communicate with people when you're actually abroad, and it's not safe to rely on the fact that most people speak English when um ... in foreign countries. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mm ... I think English people traditionally thought that ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> that foreigners always spoke English, and a lot of foreigners do, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but there are people that you meet in the street or you want to take a bus somewhere, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> then you find that you need to speak the language and it's very unnerving to be in a situation where you can't communicate with people when you do want to travel around. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MATTHEW: Have you ever been abroad and learnt er ... a language in the country? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MAGGIE: Yes, well when I was a secretary I er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> went and lived in Geneva for two years, and I learnt French at school but I ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I really didn't speak it at all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I knew it theoretically but I wasn't able to communicate with people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I was in a situation where if I didn't speak French, then I would not have been able to do my shopping and buy food, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and so I picked the language up and I made friends with French people ... Swiss French people, and I found that if I wanted to communicate with all ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> all the people that I met, then I had to learn French, and I think it's the best method of learning because you're in the situation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's very hard at times ¡ª you can sit through dinner parties and not understand what ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> what's going on and you think everybody thinks you're stupid because you can't communicate with them, but it's ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> it's the hard way but I think it's the best way to learn. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MATTHEW: Elfriede, you come from Austria and yet you've been living in England now for the last three years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Has having to learn and speak another language created great problems? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ELFRIEDE: Um ... At the beginning, yes, it was rather difficult for me to get the right job ... um. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After you've lived here for one or two years you get to know the system and then that's quite good. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You know how to use libraries and oh ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> you get to know where to um ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> call in emergencies; </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> um ... you get to know ... er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> trying to get a radio and understand the radio and all the ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> programmes they have ... um and when they're on and the little stories. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MATTHEW: What about English humour on the radio? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> ELFRIEDE: Um ... I think that takes a very very long time to understand and I'm sorry to say that I haven't managed yet to understand it completely, but er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I find it very interesting to speak other languages um ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> because English people have different er ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> have a different mentality, and have a very different character and a different temperament and it is fascinating for me to talk to them </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> um ... and also for myself to be able to express myself in a different language and to communicate with them. </T> <BR>
