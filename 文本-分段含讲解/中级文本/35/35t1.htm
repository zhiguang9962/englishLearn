&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In this recorded conversation with a friend, Alison Willson described her reactions to the news that she was going to die of cancer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The conversation took place five months before her death. </T> <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Firstly, I told myself, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The thing has happened. However much you fuss, and scream, and yell, it's not going to change." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I realised I'd got to discipline myself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Another thing was, I remembered the vicar of a church I used to go to saying that this kind of thing was often much harder for the relatives than for the patient. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So here there was scope for me to do something positive. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Thirdly, just before I left the hospital, I came across two young women in their thirties, both with small children and both with cancer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I thought, well, what am I worrying about, because my children are grown up and independent. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If I can get this right for myself and make some sort of peace with it, then the people who love me will also accept it and this needn't be too bad a time. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of course, it wasn't as simple as that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I came out of hospital I found I was getting it wrong with quite a lot of people, because they didn't look at it the same way as I did. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And again, I think if you're going to die around the age of 50, far more people are involved than if you're dying when you're really old. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You know, it's fairly threatening to people of your own age, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> they see you in the middle of a fairly busy life suddenly stopping ¡ª and they find it unacceptable. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This business again of getting them to give me permission to die ... </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Several of me friends still feel very angry and bitter about it and just won't accept it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In consequence they tell me I shouldn't accept it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I get all these stories about these heroic people who have organ after organ removed and say, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm not going to die; I'm going to live; and they go on, year after year. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It makes me feel I'm being terribly feeble. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I feel rather guilty, as if what they're saying is, well, you're not trying hard enough. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I can't really see what else I could be doing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm very confused about all this. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I don't quite understand what I ought to do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Well, I suppose one could be a Chichester and rush across the Atlantic in a boat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But you know, really, I'm too tired for that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think what I want to say to people is that if you're in this situation it isn't nearly as bad as people who try and put themselves in your position think it is. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> For one thing, other people come to it cold, whereas I've been doing my homework on it for the last two years. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've got used to the idea and have come to the point of acceptance gradually. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The other thing is that they're feeling well and vigorous, with lots of things they're in the middle of doing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I am actually getting very tired and don't feel very well. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The fact that I can't drive my car and am generally having to cut down my activities isn't as bad for me as they think it is. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I try to get this through to people, and it seems to release their anxiety a bit. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My friends are beginning to accept what is happening and come along with me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It's been a time for thinking about relationships and sorting out those which weren't very satisfactory. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Also, to a large extent, the pressure is off and you're going to die, you don't really have to do much. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's rather a relief if you're not feeling well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've been very happy these last six months. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I used to think that if you knew you were dying there would be a great black pall over everything, and nothing could be of any value. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it isn't like that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In some ways, even, you get increased appreciation of things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Colours are brighter and little pleasures mean more. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You almost get another dimension. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I feel that if I hadn't understood what was happening, and come to terms with it, this would have been lost. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So if you asked me whether I would rather have a coronary or what I've got, I would rather have this because I've had all this good time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I feel sad because other people might have it, but miss it ¡ª </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> because they aren't allowed to come to terms with what's going to happen, or don't feel able to, and this is such a waste. </T> <BR>
