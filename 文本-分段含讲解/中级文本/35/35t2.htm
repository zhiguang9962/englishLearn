&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Wang Jinghui is a lecturer in China Textile University in Shanghai. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now, at the age of fifty-three, he is about to leave this world. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In July last year, he was diagnosed as to be suffering from cancer in the esophagus. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The doctor told him that there might still be a slight chance for him if he got operated on at once, as the cancer was already in an advanced stage. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The news greatly alarmed Wang and his daughter who had accompanied him to the hospital. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Naturally they wanted to have an operation at once as there was not a moment to be lost. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But all our wards are full at the moment," the doctor told them. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How long do we have to wait then?" the daughter asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "At least two months. We have a long waiting list." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Back at home, the daughter was at her wit's end. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Five years earlier, her mother had died of cancer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was her father then who had looked after everything ！ her mother's operation, then the funeral. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And after her mother's death, it was her father who looked after her and her younger sister, and had seen them through school, and then college for her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She had just graduated and her younger sister was still at school. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How could they do without their father? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No, their father must not die. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She lost no time and spared no efforts in finding a hospital for her father. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She went everywhere and asked everybody ！ friends, relatives, acquaintances, anyone who might know of a way to, or have connections with a hospital. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A few days later one of her former schoolmates came with the heartening news that one of her friends had a relative who could pull strings with a certain big hospital. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And so this friend's friend's relative made his appearance. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He proved to be very helpful and enthusiastic, and promised to see the whole thing through. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But he constantly dropped hints to Wang's daughter about the "going price" for "road-paving" to a hospital. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> At the hospital things went as smoothly as he had promised. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Wang's daughter had handed him three hundred <I>yuan,</I> and soon he had everything arranged ！ consultation for Wang and registration for living in. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He informed them that there would be a vacant bed the following Monday. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They went home full of hope. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He, the man who had arranged everything for them, began to lay down his cards. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The going price is two thousand and five hundred <I>yuan.</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But don't worry," he hastened to add when he saw the alarm in father and daughter's faces. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I've managed to bring it down to the bottom line ！ one thousand two hundred. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But you have to get it ready soon. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have to satisfy the registration office, the surgeon-in-charge, the operating doctor and his assistant, the two anaesthetists ！  not a single one could be left out." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What else could they do? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In order to cure her father, the daughter went about and managed to scrape together 500 <I>yuan</I> which she handed to the man just before her father went to live in. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As arranged Wang entered the hospital on Monday, July 16. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But more than a week went by and nobody seemed to bother about him, and nothing was mentioned about his operation. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Both father and daughter were worried about this endless waiting and she approached the man again, to see if he could speed things up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "An operating doctor has yet to be found." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She understood what that meant, and as she was almost worried to death, she gritted her teeth and produced another four hundred <I>yuan.</I> </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Apparently the man meant what he said when he mentioned one thousand two hundred as the bottom line. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> On July 28, Wang finally was wheeled into the operation theatre. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But he was not kept there for long. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The doctor opened up his chest and found that cancer had reached such a stage as to make an operation impossible. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So merciless was the hand of fate! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When a reporter from Xinmin Evening went to see Wang early this year, she found an emaciated man lying in bed, obviously nearing his last. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could hardly produce a coherent sentence, but he kept repeating: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We've been robbed of one thousand two hundred <I>yuan</I> ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now we are penniless ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> what is going to happen to my two girls? ..." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The daughter said: "What happened to us was far from unique. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It has become quite a common practice for patients to pay through their noses in order to live in. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All the same I want our story to be told, not that I have any illusions about getting our money back." </T> <BR>
