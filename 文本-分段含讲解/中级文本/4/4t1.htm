&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A musician who played Pop Music in a Club lived in a boardinghouse in the centre of London. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He always used to get back to his room very late at night and sometimes in the early hours of the morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was so tired when he got back that he would sit on the edge of his bed, take off his shoes and throw them on the floor and say,  </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Thank goodness, another day is over." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He would then get into bed and fall fast asleep. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But the poor lodger who had the room under the musician's was woken up each night, or early in the morning, by the two thuds that the two shoes made as they landed on his ceiling. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Finally, he could not stand it any more and went and complained to the musician. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Naturally the musician was very upset and promised that, in future, after taking off his shoes, he would put them down as quietly as possible on the carpet. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The next day, he got back from his club at about one o'clock in the morning, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> went up to his room, sat on the edge of his bed, took off one shoe and threw it on the floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was just about to do the same with the other when he suddenly remembered the promise he had made the day before. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So with great care he put the second shoe down silently on the carpet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then he got into bed and fell fast asleep. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> An hour later, he was woken up by a violent knocking on his door. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was the lodger who slept in the room just under his. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Please, please, please," the lodger pleaded, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "drop the other shoe. I have been waiting for a whole hour for you to drop it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As soon as you do I can go to sleep." </T> <BR>
