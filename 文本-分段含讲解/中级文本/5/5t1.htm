&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Fire! Fire!" What terrible words to hear when one wakes up in a strange house in the middle of the night! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was a large, old, wooden house ¡ª the sort that burns beautifully ¡ª and my room was on the top floor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I jumped out of bed, opened the door and stepped out into the passage. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was full of thick smoke. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I began to run, but as I was still only half-awake, instead of going towards the stairs I went in the opposite direction. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The smoke grew thicker and I could see flames all around. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The floor became hot under my bare feet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I found an open door and ran into a room to get to the window. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But before I could reach it, one of my feet caught in something soft and I fell down. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The thing I had fallen over felt like a bundle of clothes, and I picked it up to protect my face from the smoke and heat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just then the floor gave way under me and I crashed to the floor below with pieces of burning wood all around me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I saw a flaming doorway in front, put the bundle over my face and ran. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My feet burned me terribly, but I got through. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As I reached the cold air outside, my bundle of clothes gave a thin cry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I nearly dropped it in my surprise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then I saw a crowd gathered in the street. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A woman in a night-dress and a borrowed man's coat screamed as she saw me and came running madly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "My baby! My baby!" she cried. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The crowd cheered wildly as she took the smoke-blackened bundle out of my arms. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I had some difficulty in recognizing her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was the Mayor's wife, and I had saved her baby. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was a hero! </T> <BR>
