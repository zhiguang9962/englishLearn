<T TYPE=SEN> <B>Ari, age fourteen</B> </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When my parents were married, I hardly ever saw my Dad because he was always busy working. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now that they're divorced, I've gotten to know him more because I'm with him every weekend. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I really look forward to the weekends because it's kind of like a break ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> it's like going to Disneyland because there's no set schedule, no "Be home by five-thirty" kind of stuff. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's open. It's free. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And my father is always buying me presents. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My Mom got remarried and divorced again, so I've gone through two divorces so far. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And my father's also gotten remarried ！ to someone I don't get along with all that well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's all made me feel that people shouldn't get married ！ they should just live together and make their own agreement. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then, if things get bad, they don't have to get divorced and hire lawyers and sue each other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And, even more important, they don't have to end up hating each other. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'd say that the worst part of the divorce is the money problem. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's been hard on my Mom because lots of times she can't pay her bills, and it makes her angry when I stay with my father and he buys me things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She gets mad and says things like "If he can buy you things like this, then he should be able to pay me." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I feel caught in the middle for two reasons: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> first, I can't really enjoy whatever my Dad does get for me, and second, I don't know who to believe. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My Dad's saying, "I don't really owe her any money," and my Mom's saying he does. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sometimes I fight for my Mom and sometimes I fight for my Dad, but I wish they'd leave me out of it completely. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In a lot of ways I wish my Mom would get remarried, because then she wouldn't have to worry so much about finances. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I'm sorry that my Dad got remarried, because I feel left out a lot of times. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And one thing I really worry about is that I think they want to have a baby, and I know that if they do, it will be just like a replacement for me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's because I only see my Dad on weekends, and since he would see the baby more than he'd see me, he'd probably grow to like it more than he likes me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It could be a lot like what happened with my dog Spunkur. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've had him for about six years and I've always said I'll never love any dog as much as I love him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Well, a year ago I picked up a little black Labrador puppy from the pound, and now I find I'm not as friendly with Spunkur as I used to be. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I think Spunkur feels jealous, just like I would if my Dad and my stepmother had a baby. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My Dad said it wouldn't be that way, that we'd be a whole family and I'd have a little brother or sister, which would be a lot of fun, but I told him, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Look, by the time the kid is old enough to talk, I'll be out of college. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm not going to have anything to do with a baby. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You know that it's just a replacement for me!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> If I lived full-time with my Dad, it would probably be easier for me to accept a baby because we'd be on an equal footing, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but I'd rather stay with my Mom, where life is normal ！ where we live like most people live, with breakfast at breakfast time and dinner at dinner time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I do my homework, play with my friends ！ it's all the way life should be. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If I lived with my Dad, it might be more fun at times, but I would go crazy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wouldn't want to be brought up that way. </T> <BR>
