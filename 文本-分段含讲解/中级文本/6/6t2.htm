<T TYPE=SEN> <B>Sara, age twelve </B></T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I guess the main reason I was mad at Daddy was because it all made my mother so unhappy, and I ended up feeling sorry for both of them ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> my mother because she was struggling to make ends meet, and my Dad because he couldn't really do much about it. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Even though my parents separated more than three years ago, it's still very vivid in my mind and I doubt if I'll ever forget the way I felt at the time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Yet, as awful as it was, I never hoped they'd get back together. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And now I think I'd die if they did, because it would be so awkward for me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think they're both much happier now, and it's obvious to me that they both lead totally different lives. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Since the breakup I've been able to see my parents' true colors, especially my mother's. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've seen a side of her that I never saw before. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she was married, she and Daddy were the perfect couple, always quiet, talking about dignified things, and they would never laugh or anything. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Nowadays my mother is always happy and gay. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Another way she's changed is that she always used to hide her problems from me but now she's more apt to discuss things. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think she's more relaxed ！ and so's my Dad. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Both of my parents started dating other people right away, and I think they'll both get remarried eventually, which is fine with me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They don't discuss their love lives with me all that much, but of course I'm not blind. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For example, one night I had a sleep-over at a friend's house and the next morning I came home earlier than I'd planned to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Well, I just stormed into my mother's bedroom, and there was this guy in her bed ！ she was somewhere else, in another room. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I started crying and everything, and my mother tried to convince me she had slept on the couch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now that I look back, it was pretty hilarious, and of course I don't care ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean, I understand about those kind of arrangements. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the beginning, when my father had a girlfriend sleep over, he didn't know how to tell me ！ he just sort of said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Oh, you're sleeping on the couch tonight," because at that point I didn't have my own room at his house and shared the bedroom. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's still hard for my Dad to level with me about this part of his life, but he's getting better. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Anyhow, neither of them should worry about my getting upset, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> because I'm old enough to understand that grown-ups are allowed to have private lives, which includes other people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But if someone's going to spend the night, I think it's better and less awkward if I know about it beforehand, so I'm not taken by surprise. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I still want to get married and have kids, but I have a lot of friends who don't want to. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was discussing marriage with one boy I know, and he said, "I'm never ever getting married." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He took his parents' divorce really badly because his mother and father weren't friends afterwards ！ </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> they were enemies, screaming on the phone to each other. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm glad my parents are good friends, having lunch together and stuff. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think it's so much easier for the child if the parents are friendly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If they aren't, it's really difficult because there's always a right side and a wrong side and the kids are just caught in the middle. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I think I've grown up a little faster because of my parents' divorce. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's made me realize more about the problems of life and helped me to understand my parents ！ and appreciate them as individuals. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's just too bad they couldn't have been as happy and productive as a couple as they've been since they've been on their own. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And I also wish that the next time my mother has tickets for a Rolling Stones concert, she takes me instead of her boyfriend, which is what she did the last time! </T> <BR>
