&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Gretel and Mrs. Clark went shopping in the centre of London yesterday. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I'd like to know which store you like best in London, Mrs. Clark," Gretel said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Now that's a difficult question," Mrs. Clark replied. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I just haven't any idea which store I like best. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are so many huge stores in London. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suppose Selfridges must be the biggest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There's so much variety there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I can usually find what I'm looking for. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then there's Liberty's. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's such a lovely building. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Harrods is very famous, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's such a smart store. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I love all the big stores in London because you can walk round and nobody bothers you. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Nobody tries to sell you anything ¡ª unless you want to buy something. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Sometimes I go window-shopping, or just wander round a store and look at the things on display. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The big stores are one of the sights of London. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I went to the sales in January. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That was one of the sights of London, too! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My goodness! The crowds! But it was worth it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I bought some lovely things very cheaply. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was good fun, but very exhausting." </T> <BR>
