&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As she walked round the huge department store, Edith reflected how difficult it was to choose a suitable Christmas present for her father. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She wished that he was as easy to please as her mother, who was always delighted with perfume. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Besides, shopping at this time of the year was a most disagreeable experience: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> people trod on your toes, poked you with their elbows and almost knocked you over in their haste to get to a bargain ahead of you. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Partly to have a rest, Edith paused in front of a counter where some attractive ties were on display. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "They are real silk." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> the assistant assured her, trying to tempt her. "Worth double the price." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But Edith knew from past experience that her choice of ties hardly ever pleased her father. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She moved on reluctantly and then, quite by chance, stopped where a small crowd of men had gathered round a counter. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She found some good quality pipes on sale - and the prices were very reasonable. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Edith did not hesitate for long: </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> although her father only smoked a pipe occasionally, she knew that this was a present which was bound to please him. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When she got home, with her small but well-chosen present concealed in her handbag, her parents were already at table having supper. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her mother was in especially cheerful mood. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Your father has at last decided to stop smoking," she informed her daughter. </T> <BR>
