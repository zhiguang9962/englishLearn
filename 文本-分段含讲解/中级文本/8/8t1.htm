&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Hal Bohlman, his wife Judy, and their three children live in a small apartment. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Hal works in the income tax division of the government where he is a public information officer. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Their children are now 12, 10 and 5 years old. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Their plan is for Judy to return to work after their youngest child starts elementary school next year. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They hope to save up enough money to buy a house, since they feel their present two bedroom apartment is much too crowded. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Last week, however, Judy's father died suddenly of a heart attack. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They now have to decide what to do about Judy's mother, since Judy is the only child. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Judy's father was the manager of a store in a large supermarket chain, so her mother will receive a modest but sufficient pension from the company. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In addition, she will receive the money from her husband's life insurance and will continue to receive social welfare benefits from the government. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In order to avoid inheritance taxes, her husband in his will left his estate to Judy with the provision that his wife would have use of it as long as she lived. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Judy realizes that it would probably be dangerous for her mother to live alone. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Although her health is basically good for someone her age, 73, she has bad days when her heart or arthritis acts up. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Judy is afraid she might have trouble taking care of herself now that she is alone. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She is living in the house that she and her husband owned, a three bedroom house in the suburbs of the same city where Hal and Judy live. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Hal and Judy's mother never got along well in the past, but Hal realizes that Judy is worried about her mother. </T> <BR>
