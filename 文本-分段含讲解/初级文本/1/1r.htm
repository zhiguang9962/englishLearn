&nbsp; &nbsp;  The river, you see, was never really safe at that time of the year ¡ª early autumn, I mean, when there is heavy rainfall. So when I heard the children had gone swimming, as they used to all spring and summer, I knew there might be an awful accident. And when they came home late without little Katie, I guessed what had happened.
