<T TYPE=SEN> A: Hello, 332440. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> B: Oh hello, Sally. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is Dave Thomson here. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Could I speak to Jim please? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> A: I'm afraid he's not in at the moment, Dave. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> B: Any idea when he might be back? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> A: Well, he shouldn't be long. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He said he was just going to get some paint. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> B: OK. Well, tell him I've called, will you, and I'll try again later. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> A: All right. Goodbye, Dave. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> B: Thanks then Sally. Goodbye. </T> <BR>
