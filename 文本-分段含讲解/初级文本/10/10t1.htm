&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One day Mrs. Jones went shopping. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When her husband came home in the evening, she began to tell him about a beautiful cotton dress. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I saw it in a shop this morning," she said, "and ..." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "And you want to buy it," said her husband. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "How much does it cost?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Forty pounds." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Forty pounds for a cotton dress? That is too much!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But every evening, when Mr. Jones came back from work, his wife continued to speak only about the dress, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and at last, after a week, he said, "Oh, buy the dress! Here is the money!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was very happy. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But the next evening, when Mr. Jones came home and asked, "Have you got the famous dress?" she said, "No." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Why not?" he said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, it was still in the window of the shop after a week, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> so I thought, nobody else wants this dress, so I don't want it either." </T> <BR>
