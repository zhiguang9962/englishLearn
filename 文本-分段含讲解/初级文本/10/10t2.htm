&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Jane Foster has just met Henry Taylor. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Jane is on her way to the hospital to see her friend, Susan Green. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: Where are you going, Jane? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: I'm going to the hospital to see Susan Green. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: I saw her yesterday. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was a little better. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: No, you needn't. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: Number 13 buses run much more frequently, don't they? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: Yes. I caught a number 7 bus yesterday, and I had to wait for half an hour at the bus stop. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: Thank you, Henry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'll get a number 13. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> HENRY: But number 13 buses leave from the centre of town. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You'll have to walk two miles to catch one. </T> <BR>
