<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs. Neat was tidy and orderly. One day she got on a bus, went up on top and sat down. When the conductor asked her for her fare, she opened her bag, took out her purse, closed her bag, opened her purse, took out a shilling, closed her purse, opened her bag, put in her purse and closed her bag. She paid her fare. The conductor gave her a ticket.
