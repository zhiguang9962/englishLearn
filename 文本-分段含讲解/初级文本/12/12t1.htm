<T TYPE=SEN> MR. FIELD: You mustn't touch the wet paint, Bill. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: I'm sorry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I won't do it again. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. FIELD: Try to be more careful in future. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: I shall. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wasn't as careless as John Sampson. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He walked across that wet cement over there. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. FIELD: The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a notice. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: The headmaster asked them not to do so£® </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. FIELD: Then why isn't there a notice? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: They went to their stores to get one. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here they come with it now! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. FIELD: But look at them! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice! </T> <BR>
