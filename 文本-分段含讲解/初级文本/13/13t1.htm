&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> John liked chocolates very much, but his mother never gave him any, because they were bad for his teeth, she thought. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But John had a very nice grandfather. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The old man loved his grandson very much, and sometimes he brought John chocolates when he came to visit him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then his mother let him eat them, because she wanted to make the old man happy. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One evening, a few days before John's seventh birthday, he was saying his prayers in his bedroom before he went to bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Please, God," he shouted, "make them give me a big box of chocolates for my birthday on Saturday." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> His mother was in the kitchen, but she heard the small boy shouting and went into his bedroom quickly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Why are you shouting, John?" she asked her son. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "God can hear you when you talk quietly." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I know," answered the clever boy with a smile, "but Grandfather's in the next room, and he can't." </T> <BR>
