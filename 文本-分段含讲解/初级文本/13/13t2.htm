&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Later that day, Steve told the group that he had decided to go back to Edinburgh. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I want to see the rest of the Festival," he explained. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That evening, they all went to a pub for a final drink with Steve. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They left a message for Malc: GONE TO THE WHITE HORSE. SEE YOU THERE! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Malc arrived back quite late. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He went round to the pub immediately. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was feeling very pleased with himself. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: How did it go, then? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: Oh, fantastic! I took some really good photographs. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm sure I shall win that competition. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: Well, you'd better buy us all a drink, then! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: Yes ... What would you all like? </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Malc goes to the bar) <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I'd like four pints of best bitter ... oh, and two lagers and lime. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BARMAN: ... Oh, excuse me, sir. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How old are you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: Sixteen. Why? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BARMAN: Well, I'm afraid you're too young to buy alcohol. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You have to be eighteen, you know. </T> <BR>
