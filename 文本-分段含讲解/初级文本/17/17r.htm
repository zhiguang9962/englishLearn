<BR> Peter: Hello, Jim. What was the film like?
<BR> Jim: Awful. It was a complete waste of time.
<BR> Peter: Why? What was it about?
<BR> Jim: It was about a married couple. They had to live with the wife's mother, because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own.
<BR> Peter: A lot of young people have to do that.
<BR> Jim: Yes, but the husband had to work overtime three times a week, so he was always tired.
<BR> Peter: It sounds like the story of my life.
<BR> Jim: Yes, it does, doesn't it? But this man was always over-tired, and he couldn't sleep. So he used to take two sleeping pills every night. 
<BR> Peter: I take sleeping pills sometimes.
<BR> Jim: Yes, but not two every night. Anyway, the strain was too much for him. He had a nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital.
<BR> Peter: It sounds a very depressing film.
<BR> Jim: Not really. His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter, because she could speak French and German fluently. After a few months' work, she had a better job than her husband. So in the end, they were able to buy a house, and he didn't have to work any more. Stupid, wasn't it?
<BR> Peter: I don't know. My wife used to speak French. I must tell her to brush it up.
