<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Frank is very busy. He is talking to Jimmy, his best friend.
<BR> Jimmy: Did you play football yesterday?
<BR> Frank: Yes, I played with Tony and John.
<BR> Jimmy: What did you do after you'd played football?
<BR> Frank: We all went swimming.
<BR> Jimmy: Are you going swimming again this afternoon?
<BR> Frank: No, we aren't. We're going to help Mr. Smith to plant some flowers.
<BR> Jimmy: Are you helping him all afternoon?
<BR> Frank: Yes, we are. We can neither play football nor do our homework today.
<BR> Jimmy: You're going to be very busy.
<BR> Frank: Yes, we certainly are. But Mr. Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do.
