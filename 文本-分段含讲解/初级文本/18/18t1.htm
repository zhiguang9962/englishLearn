&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It was two weeks before Christmas, and Mrs. Smith was very busy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She bought a lot of Christmas cards to send to her friends and to her husband's friends, and put them on the table in the living-room. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then, when her husband came home from work, she said to him, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Here are the Christmas cards for our friends, and here are some stamps, a pen and our book of addresses. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Will you please write the cards while I am cooking the dinner?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith did not say anything, but walked out of the living-room and went to his study. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Smith was very angry with him, but did not say anything either. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Then a minute later he came back with a box full of Christmas cards. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All of them had addresses and stamps on them. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "These are from last year," he said, "I forgot to post them." </T> <BR>
