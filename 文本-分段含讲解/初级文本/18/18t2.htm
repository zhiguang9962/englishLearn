<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: Why? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> PETER: Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: Yes, they do. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you have a Christmas tree this year? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> PETER: Yes, we have a big tree this year. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I bought the decorations at the five-and-ten-cent store yesterday. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you want to come and see it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> PTEER: When can you come? </T> <BR>

<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Hi, boys. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Are you going to make any New Year resolutions this year? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> PETER: No, I never make any. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JOHN: I make them, but I break them the next day. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Are you making any, Mary? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Yes, but I can't tell you what they are. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> PETER: You'd better make one about losing 20 or 30 pounds. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MARY: Meanie! You'd better make one about saying nice things to girls. </T> <BR>
