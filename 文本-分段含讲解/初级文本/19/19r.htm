<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Todd heard all the hammering behind the Marsey's house. He went to see what was going on. Jeff Marsey was making something from long pieces of wood.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     "What is it?" Todd asked.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     "A pair of stilts," Jeff said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     Todd knew that stilts could make you several feet taller. Jeff was putting blocks of wood on the stilts. These were for his feet to rest on. Once you got used to them, you could walk anywhere on stilts.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     "I'm also making a pair of long pants," Jeff said. "They'll come all the way down and cover the stilts. I'll look like a giant."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     As the summer went on, Todd forgot all about the stilts.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     One night Todd was watching television. His cousin came running in the front door. He'd never seen her so excited.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "You'd better call the police," she said.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Why?" asked Todd.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I was walking home," she said. "I looked up and saw a ¡ª a giant. He was following me. He wore big baggy pants. He was very stiff and straight. Each step was a huge step. I'm going to call the police."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Wait," said Todd. "It wasn't a giant. You'll be surprised when I tell you who it was!"
