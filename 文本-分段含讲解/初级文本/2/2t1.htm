&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One day Tom said to one of his friends, "I'm going to have a holiday in Beijing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I don't speak Chinese, so I'll go to evening classes and have Chinese lessons for a month before I go." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He studied very hard for a month, and then his holidays began and he went to China. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When he came back a few weeks later, his friend said to him, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Did you have any trouble with your Chinese when you were in Beijing, Tom?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "No, I didn't have any trouble with it," answered Tom. "But the Chinese did!" </T> <BR>
