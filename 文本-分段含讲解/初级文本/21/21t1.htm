&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Bill is in Victor's house and he is sitting down. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is leaning back and he has put his feet on the table. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Bill is very rude. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> VICTOR: Would you mind taking your feet off the table, Bill? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: Not at all. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I was very comfortable. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> VICTOR: Do you put your feet on your own table? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: No, I never do that. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> VICTOR: Why not? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: I don't want to mark my table, of course. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> VICTOR: Well, will you please avoid marking mine? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: I'm sorry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I thought you were going to buy a new table soon. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> VICTOR: I hope to buy a new table, but I have to sell my old one first. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: Would you please tell me how much you want for it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> VICTOR: How much do you think it's worth? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BILL: Not much. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's badly marked. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'll give you ten dollars for it. </T> <BR>
