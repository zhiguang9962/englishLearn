&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Yesterday morning Paul said to himself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I've got to write that economics paper today. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If I don't do anything else, I've got to write that paper." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He sat down at his desk and put a sheet of paper into his typewriter. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He looked out of the window, ate a piece of candy, got up to get a drink of water, brushed his teeth, and sat down at his desk again. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I haven't written my family since Thanksgiving," he said to himself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I'll write them a letter first." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Paul wrote his family a long letter. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "My typewriter needs a new ribbon. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've got to change this ribbon before I write my economics paper." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The ink from the typewriter ribbon got his hands very dirty, so he washed them and washed them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> While he was washing his hands, he noticed that his fingernails were much too long. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He cut them very carefully and then went back to his desk. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He put a sheet of paper into his typewriter, looked out of the window, and looked at his watch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was noon. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I'll get some lunch now," he said to himself. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "After lunch I'll write that paper, if I don't do anything else." </T> <BR>
