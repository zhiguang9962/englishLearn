<BR> Mrs. Smith: Hello, Mrs. Turnbull. How are you?
<BR> Mrs. Turnbull: Fine, thanks. How's your boy, Jack?
<BR> Mrs. Smith: He's a bit tired. You know, he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning. He doesn't get home till after four. Then he does his homework after tea. It often takes him a couple of hours to finish it.
<BR> Mrs. Turnbull: Poor boy. They work hard at school nowadays, don't they? Does he like it?
<BR> Mrs. Smith: School, you mean? Yes, he does. He likes his teachers, and that always makes a difference.
<BR> Mrs. Turnbull: Yes, it does. Does he go to school by bus?
<BR> Mrs. Smith: No, he walks. He likes walking. He meets some of his friends at the corner and they go together.
<BR> Mrs. Turnbull: What does he do when it rains?
<BR> Mrs. Smith: My husband takes him in the car. He passes the school on the way to the office.
