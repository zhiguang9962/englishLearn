<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: When in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: What do the Romans do? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: They live in Rome, of course, and go to work by car or bus. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams, so they walk. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: In other words, the Romans do what everyone else does. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: Yes, but they do it differently. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everything is different. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: What do you mean? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: Well, the climate's different for a start. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The sun shines more often. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: I envy them the sun. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: I know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You hate the rain, don't you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: I certainly do. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: And a Roman really loves life. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He knows how to enjoy himself. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: They always eat spaghetti and drink wine, don't they? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: Not always. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But they like a good meal. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food, you know. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MRS. TURNBULL: Really? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How much does it cost to fly to Rome? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. TURNBULL: I don't know exactly, but it costs a lot of money. </T> <BR>
