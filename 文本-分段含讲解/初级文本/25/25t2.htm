&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Colin is talking to Jack about yesterday evening. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Jack went out, but Colin had to stay at home. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: Why did your parents make you stay at home? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> COLIN: They wanted to go out, and so they made me look after my baby brother. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: Didn't you mind doing it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> COLIN: No, I didn't. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: Didn't you even want to go to the cinema? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> COLIN: Not really. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I watched television for an hour. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: What was on television last night? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> COLIN: Boxing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was excellent. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: Oh. I enjoy watching boxing on television, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What a pity I missed it last night! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> COLIN: What did you do last night? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JACK: I went to a boxing-match in the sports stadium. </T> <BR>
