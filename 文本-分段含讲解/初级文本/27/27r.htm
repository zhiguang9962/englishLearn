<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Two young British tourists were travelling in France when a policeman stopped their car and gave it a search. He found a bag of white powder which looked suspicious. <I>"Drogue?"</I> asked the heroin-conscious policeman. "Yes, dogs," they responded, and promptly found themselves in jail. Analysis of the powder revealed that it was a chemical which gives off a smell, used to discourage dogs from using the sides of the car as a toilet. The tourists were set free, after promising to take a few French lessons before their next vacation in France.
