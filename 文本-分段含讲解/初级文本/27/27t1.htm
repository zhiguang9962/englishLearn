&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Black was having a lot of trouble with her skin, so she went to her doctor about it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could not find anything wrong with her, however, so he sent her to the local hospital for tests. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The hospital, of course, sent the results of the tests direct to Mrs. Black's doctor, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and the next morning he telephoned her to give her a list of the things that he thought she should not eat, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> as any of them might be the cause of her skin trouble. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Black carefully wrote all the things down on a piece of paper, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> which she then left beside the telephone while she went out to a ladies' meeting. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When she got back home two hours later, she found her husband waiting for her. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had a big basket full of packages beside him, and when he saw her, he said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Hullo, dear. I have done all your shopping for you." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Done all my shopping?" she asked in surprise. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "But how did you know what I wanted?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, when I got home, I found your shopping list beside the telephone," answered her husband, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "so I went down to the shops and bought everything you had written down." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of course, Mrs. Black had to tell him that he had bought all the things the doctor did not allow her to eat! </T> <BR>
