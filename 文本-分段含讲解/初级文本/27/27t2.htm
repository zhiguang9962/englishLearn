&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Betty and Jean are on their way to work. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: What was the party like last night, Jean? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: Not bad at all, thanks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There were one or two interesting people there. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why couldn't you come? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: Well, I couldn't get away from work early. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And when I got home I had a headache, so I had to go straight to bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I was over-tired, because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: What a shame. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why didn't you take a sleeping pill? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: I don't like them. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I used to take them when I had to work overtime, you know. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: How many did you use to take? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: Three every night. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: Good heavens. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Why did you take so many? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: Because I was under a terrible strain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The doctor said they weren't very strong. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Anyway, I used to feel awful the next morning. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: I'm sure you did. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: The doctor said I had to be careful. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JEAN: He was quite right. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> BETTY: So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead. </T> <BR>
