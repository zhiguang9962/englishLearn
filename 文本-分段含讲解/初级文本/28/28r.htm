<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; An Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman each owed a friend of theirs a pound. The man died. They agreed that their debts were debts of honour and must be paid, and that each one should go to the dead man's house, leave a pound and ask that it should be buried with him, as he had no relatives. The Englishman went and left a pound; so did the Irishman. The Scotsman went to the house, took the two pounds, wrote a cheque for three pounds and asked that it should be buried with the dead man.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; But the undertaker (the man who arranges funerals) was a Welshman. He found the cheque, cashed it and kept the money.
