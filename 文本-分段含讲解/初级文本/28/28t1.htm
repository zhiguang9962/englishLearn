&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Adamson enjoys playing the violin in his leisure time. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is often carried away by his music. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it is a terrible time for his neighbours when Mr. Adamson plays as he does so badly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One day Mr. Adamson sat by a window and began to play the violin as usual. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Adamson seems to be making noises instead of music. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> However, Mr. Adamson was absorbed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just then, some stones were thrown out of the window under which Mr. Adamson was sitting, but he did not pay attention to it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The "music" continued. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After a little while, an empty bottle and a worn-out shoe were thrown out of the window too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Adamson knew that this was not the place for him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The neighbours did not like his "music". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Adamson was very sad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was badly hurt. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Perhaps no living people can understand my music. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I should go to a place where people may appreciate my works." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So he decided to go to a graveyard. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He came to a graveyard where there was no other sound except the church toll. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The yard was a Heaven where dead people rest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Adamson sat at a grave and thought a lot, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I must do my best to show that my music is outstanding." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was inspired and began to play his violin. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Suddenly a barefoot stretched out from the grave and gave Mr. Adamson a kick which sent him flying. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His treasured violin also dropped from his hand. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Adamson felt very sad because his works was not accepted by anyone, not even the dead. </T> <BR>
