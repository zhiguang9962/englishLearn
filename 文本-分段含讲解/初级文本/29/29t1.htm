&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One morning last summer Mrs. Andrews made some sausage sandwiches for her husband's lunch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was one sausage left over. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Andrews didn't care for sausages herself and so she gave the last one to Henry, their little dog. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Henry ate it up quickly. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> During the morning the dog got ill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He wouldn't stop shaking his head and he couldn't stand up properly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Andrews thought, "He has eaten something that didn't agree with him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Maybe that sausage was bad ..." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She suddenly remembered her husband's lunch. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She ran to the telephone and called Jim at the office. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Jim, I hope you haven't eaten any of those sandwiches yet." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yes, I have ... " </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You have? Well, listen ¡ª don't eat any more. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I gave Henry the last sausage and now he's ill. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Go to the doctor, Jim. Tell the doctor about the dog. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Get some medicine at once." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Jim came home at lunchtime and went to bed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I had a very unpleasant hour with the doctor," he told his wife. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The medicine made me very sick." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The next morning Jim was fine. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Henry seemed quite well again too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At eleven o'clock the milkman came with the milk. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Good morning, Mrs. Andrews," The milkman said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "How's your dog this morning? I have been thinking about him ..." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Have you? Well, he seems alright now, but ..." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yesterday morning he and I had a little accident. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He jumped up at me and I dropped a bottle of milk on his head." </T> <BR>
