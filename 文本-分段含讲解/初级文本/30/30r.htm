<P align=center><B>There Are Some Things You Can't Get Away Without</B></P> <BR>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a confession to make, and the sooner it gets out in the open, the better I'll feel about it. I don't drive a car.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Americans are broad-minded people. They'll accept the fact that a person can be an alcoholic, a dope fiend, a wife beater, and even a newspaperman, but if a man doesn't drive, there is something wrong with him. 
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Through the years I've found it very embarrassing to admit it to anyone, and my best friends tend to view me with suspicion and contempt.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    But where I really run into trouble is when I go into a store and try to make a purchase with a check.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    It happened again last week when I went to a discount house at a large shopping center in Maryland. I wanted to buy a portable typewriter, and the salesman was very helpful about showing me the different models.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    I decided on one, and then I said, "May I write out a personal check?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Naturally," he said kindly. "Do you have any identification?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Of course," I said. I produced an American Express credit card, a Diner's Club credit card, a Bell Telephone credit card, and my pass to the White House.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    The man inspected them all and then said, "Where's your driver's license?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I don't have one," I replied.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Did you lose it?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "No, I didn't lose it. I don't drive a car."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    He pushed a button under the cash register, and suddenly a floor manager came rushing over.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    The salesman had now become surly. "This guy's trying to cash a check, and he doesn't have a driver's license. Should I call the store detective?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Wait a minute. I'll talk to him," the manager said. "Did you lose your driver's license for some traffic offense?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "No, I've never driven. I don't like to drive."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Nobody likes to drive," the floor manager shouted. "That's no excuse. Why are you trying to cash a check if you don't have a driver's license?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I thought all the other identification was good enough," I explained.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    By this time the president of the store had arrived on the scene. Fortunately, he recognized my name and okayed the check. He was very embarrassed by the treatment I had received and said, "Come on, I'll buy you a drink."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "I forgot to tell you," I said. "I don't drink either."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    This was too much, even for him, and he pushed me toward the door.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Get out of here," he said, "and don't come back!"
