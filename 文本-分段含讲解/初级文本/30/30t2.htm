&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Claire Walton is working at home on a Sunday afternoon. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The phone rings. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is an old friend. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Hello. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Hello, Claire. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is Mick. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Mick! Nice to hear from you again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How are you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Fine, thanks. And you? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Oh, not so bad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've been very busy, but I'm going away on holiday soon. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Good. Listen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At our new house. And ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: New house? Really? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Yes. We've moved. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's why we're giving the party. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Can you come? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Well, that depends. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When is it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: This Saturday evening. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Well ... I'm going away on Sunday morning. Very early. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Will the party go on very late? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Until two in the morning. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But you don't have to stay that long. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Well? What about it? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: All right. I'll come. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I'd like to bring a present. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Something for your new house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What would you like? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Nothing. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean, don't bring anything. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It isn't necessary. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: But I'd still like ... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Just bring yourself! I'm looking forward to seeing you again. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's been a long time! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Yes, it has. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm looking forward to seeing you, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And your new house. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Uh ... when does the party start? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Come any time after eight. All right? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Yes. Oh, by the w... </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MICK: Bye! See you on Saturday evening. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CLAIRE: Wait a moment, Mick. You haven't ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mick? Are you still there? You haven't given me your new address. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Hello? Mick? Hello? </T> <BR>
