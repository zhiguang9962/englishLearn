<BR> Doctor: Good morning. How are you?
<BR> Patient: I'm very worried, doctor.
<BR> Doctor: Oh? What are you worried about?
<BR> Patient: I'm afraid that I'm very ill.
<BR> Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think so?
<BR> Patient: Because I feel tired all the time, even when I wake up in the morning. I find it very difficult to do any work. I have no appetite. My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little.
<BR> Doctor: How do you sleep?
<BR> Patient: Very badly, doctor.
<BR> Doctor: Do you find it difficult to get to sleep, or do you wake up early?
<BR> Patient: Both, doctor. I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five.
<BR> Doctor: Are you worried about anything?
<BR> Patient: Well, yes, I am. I'm worried about my work. I've just taken a new job. I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work. I'm always afraid of making a mistake.
<BR> Doctor: I see. Please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch.
<BR> Patient: Yes, doctor.
<BR> (The doctor examines the patient)
<BR> Doctor: Well, there's nothing very much wrong with you, I'm glad to say. You're working too hard and worrying too much. Do you take much exercise? 
<BR> Patient: No, doctor. I never have enough time for exercise. I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening. Then I can't get to sleep. Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep?
<BR> Doctor: I can, but I'm not going to. You don't need medicine. You need advice. Don't work so hard. Too much work is bad for you. Don't worry about your work. It's silly to worry. Take regular exercise.
<BR> Patient: But I may lose my job, doctor! It's hard to get a job like mine.
<BR> Doctor: Then get an easier one, even if you earn less money. Which would you rather have, health or wealth?
<BR> Patient: You're right, doctor. It's more important to be healthy than wealthy. I'll change my job. I'm grateful for your advice.
<BR> Doctor: Come and see me again in a month's time. I think you'll be a different man!
