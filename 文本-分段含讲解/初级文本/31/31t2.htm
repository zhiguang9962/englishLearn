&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Malc went to the Casualty Department of the hospital. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There he was examined by the doctor. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> DOCTOR: Right. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just take off your jacket and shirt. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And lie down on that bed over there ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's right ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now, just hold up your right arm, will you? ... </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Does this hurt? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: No. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> DOCTOR: And this? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: Yes ... a bit ... ouch! </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> DOCTOR: And do you feel anything when I do this? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: Yes, that hurts quite a lot. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> DOCTOR: And you don't feel any pain anywhere else? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In your legs, for example? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MALC: No, nothing. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> DOCTOR: Well, it's probably nothing serious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I think we'd better have that shoulder X-rayed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We can't do that until the morning, though. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So it'd be better if you stayed in hospital for the night ... </T> <BR>
