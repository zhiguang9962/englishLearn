&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Wilson and Mr. Dawson are watching some men playing chess. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. WILSON: Let's play chess. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAWSON: I haven't played chess for a long time. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. WILSON: That's all right. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm a beginner. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I've just learnt how to play. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAWSON: Look, there's a chessboard. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Those two men have already finished playing. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. WILSON (after they have played for a few minutes): You're a very good player. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAWSON: Not really, but once I won a prize. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. WILSON: So did I. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. DAWSON: My prize was for the best player in the country. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now let's start playing chess seriously. </T> <BR>
