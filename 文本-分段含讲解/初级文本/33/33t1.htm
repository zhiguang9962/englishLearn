&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Jane and Lise have had lunch with Uncle David and Aunt Janet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The two old people are deaf, and the girls are tired because they have had to shout. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They both want to leave. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: We'll have to leave soon, Aunt Janet. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> AUNT JANET: Yes, of course you can have some tea, dear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'll go and make some. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: Oh no, Lise. Stop her! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You'd better say it louder. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE, AUNT JANET. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> UNCLE DAVID: You can't leave yet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I want to hear some more about Canada. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: But I must go back and look after Malcolm. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Oh dear, they didn't hear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I MUST GO BACK AND LOOK AFTER MALCOLM. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> AUNT JANET: Why, what's the matter with him? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: I TOLD YOU, AUNT JANET. HE ISN'T WELL. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> AUNT JANET: But I thought you said he was in the hotel. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Where are you staying? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: We're camping ... WE'RE CAMPING. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> AUNT JANET: In this weather? Well, I'm not surprised Malcolm isn't well. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps I ought to come out and see him. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE (firmly): NO, THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA, AUNTIE. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> HE'S ILL. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> UNCLE DAVID: What's the matter with him? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: He's got a cold. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> JANE: He's got a temperature. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> LISE: Oh, what's the use? HE'S GOT A COLD. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> UNCLE DAVID: All right, all right, we can hear. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We're not deaf! </T> <BR>
