&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many years ago in another country there lived a poor student. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had very little money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He lived in a very small room over a restaurant. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His room was at the back of the building over the kitchen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The restaurant owner was a very mean man. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Nobody liked him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But he was a good cook and many people came to his restaurant. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One day he was working quietly in his kitchen when he heard the poor student talking to his friend. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "You must be very unhappy," said his friend, "living in a poor room like this." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh no," said the student, "I am busy with my studies and I'm not interested in my room." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But you only eat plain rice ¡ª you don't have money for anything tasty." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yes, it's true, I eat only plain rice. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the delicious smells that come from the kitchen make the rice very tasty indeed." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The restaurant owner was furious. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This student was stealing the smells from his kitchen. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He decided to take him to court. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Everybody in the court laughed when the mean man accused the student of stealing his smells. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the judge took him seriously. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Every man should be able to complain to the court," he said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When the restaurant owner told the judge everything, the judge said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You are right. The student is guilty." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The restaurant owner was delighted, but the poor student was very much afraid. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What could he do? He had only a few coins in his pocket. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The judge asked the student if he had any money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The student took 5 coins from his pocket and held them out to the judge in his right hand. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Let the coins fall into your left hand," said the judge. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The courtroom was very quiet. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everyone heard the tinkle of the coins as they fell into the student's left hand. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well," said the judge to the restaurant owner, "you've heard his money. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You've been well paid for your smells." </T> <BR>
