&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Tom was sick with disappointment. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The piano recital had turned out well, all except for his solo. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He couldn't understand how it could have happened. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He had practised for weeks that seemed like months. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had given up sports until after the recital because he wanted to make his parents proud of him. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He spent all his time with the piano. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> His teacher had said he was gifted. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was true that he accepted music as another language, another way to talk to people. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> His grandparents, aunt, and uncle all came to hear him play, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and he was anxious to show them that he was the best in the whole class. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But, when he stood up to go to the piano, his knees felt weak. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He looked into the audience and saw his family smiling back at him. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> His mouth went dry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His fingers began to tremble. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The trembling became uncontrollable shaking as though he had caught a bad cold. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He sat down at the piano. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He took a deep breath. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He played the first five bars of his music, then realized with horror that he had forgotten the rest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He started over, thinking that would help. It didn't. </T>
<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He stood up as if in slow motion and walked off the stage. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was a failure. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The demon stage fright had left a brilliant musical career in ruins. </T> <BR>
