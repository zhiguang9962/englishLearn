<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Long ago there lived two brothers who were very poor. They lived in tiny huts at opposite sides of their large wheat field. At the end of each summer, when harvest time came, the brothers divided the grain they had grown into two equal parts. Some of it they took to be milled into flour, from which they baked bread. The rest was sold for money, with which they bought shoes, clothing, and tools.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;     Although they toiled from sunup to sundown, six days a week, they hardly had enough to eat. In spite of this, they were happy because of their great love for one another.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    But one year, Simon, the younger brother, felt a great sadness.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    His wife said, "Tell me what is making you so blue? You no longer sing while you work, and the twinkle is gone from your eye. "
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "You are right, dear wife. I am worried about my older brother, Ruben. He is alone in the world, with neither wife nor children. Who will care for him when he gets old and can no longer work? If only he had some money to save for his old age! It isn't fair that we share the harvest equally. But he is proud and will not accept gifts from me. What shall I do?"
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Would you take food from your own children? " She asked in astonishment. "There is nothing you can do, " she said. "So forget it."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Simon knew that his wife was right, but he was determined to help Ruben, come what might.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Meanwhile, Ruben was sitting under a tree, thinking deeply. When he noticed a bird on the way to its winter home, he said, "That bird and I are fortunate because we are free. Neither of us has a wife and children always needing to be fed. But my poor brother, Simon, is burdened with a family.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "It isn't fair that we share the harvest equally. Surely he deserves more than I! But he is very proud and will not accept gifts from me. What can I do? In several days we'll take our harvest to town. If I don't think of a plan soon, it will be too late."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    That night, when the moon was high in the sky, Ruben went quietly to his barn where he filled a sack with wheat and put in on his shoulder. Then he crossed the empty field to his brother's hut and secretly placed his wheat with Simon's.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Ah," he said when he had finished, "this is better. Now my dear younger brother will have more than I."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Ruben went happily back to his hut and slept soundly for the first time in weeks.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    An hour later, Simon woke up with a start. He had dreamed of a marvelous plan. He crept out of bed, got dressed, and went to his barn. Filling a sack with wheat, walking across the field to Ruben's hut, and placing it there took very little time. Before long, he was back in bed, pulling up the covers.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Now I can sleep peacefully," he thought, "because Ruben will have a little extra to save for his old age."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    The next morning Ruben and Simon were amazed. How could this be? Their piles were equal, yet each knew he had secretly given wheat to his brother. Something must have gone wrong.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    So that night Ruben waited until midnight, when he again took Simon some of his grain. "There! Now I am fully awake and I'm sure I put it on his pile. Tomorrow mine will be smaller and his larger, as it should be."
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    A short time later, Simon did the same. He, too, was sure that all would be well this time.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    But when day dawned, each brother saw that his share was exactly half the harvest. Ruben and Simon were desperate. Tomorrow they were to go to town to sell their grain. Tonight was their last chance.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Midnight came again. But this time Ruben and Simon chose the same moment to carry out their mission of brotherly love. Each placed a sack of wheat on his shoulders and began to walk across the field. Halfway across they met.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    "Ruben! What are you doing out so late at night?" cried Simon in dismay. He tried to hide his sack.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;    Startled, Ruben dropped his bundle. Then he saw Simon's sack and they both began to laugh. When they finished laughing, they hugged each other tightly. Their hearts were full of love for each other and they were content.
