&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Once upon a time there was an Austrian emperor who made it a rule to interview every one of his soldiers once a year. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> During the interviews he invariably asked three questions ¡ª </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "How old are you?", "How long have you been in my army?" and "Are you satisfied with your pay and the food you get?" ¡ª in that order. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One year, the day before the imperial interviews, a Frenchman got himself enlisted in the Austrian army. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Since he knew no German he was on tenterhooks. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now there was an old soldier in his unit who knew a little French and was anxious to help. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In fact he knew just about enough French to be able to teach his young friend the shortest possible answers, in the proper order, to the imperial questions. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The day arrived with all the sound and colour that befitted it. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Emperor in all his splendour was seated on the throne, his entourage attending respectfully in the background. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The soldiers filed past him, each taking barely half a minute during which time the questions were asked and the answers reverently provided. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When the Frenchman's turn came, far from being nervous he was sure of himself, having recited the answers, in the proper order, he did not know how many times. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Emperor looked at him long and hard and suddenly took it into his head that he had seen the young man somewhere before. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He began, a little out of the usual order, with the second question: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "How long have you been in my army?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Twenty-one years," replied the Frenchman, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> not without some pride in his ability to learn a foreign language so quickly and so well. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The monarch was surprised, for the young man did not look very much older than that, but he went on to ask: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Then how old are you?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "One day," came the answer. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> That was too much for the Emperor, who sat back and muttered: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Well, well. That beats me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It seems either you're mad or I am." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Positive that that was the last of the imperial questions, the proud linguist stepped forward and with a smile said: </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Both, your majesty." </T> <BR>
