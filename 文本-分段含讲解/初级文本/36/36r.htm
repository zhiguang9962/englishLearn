<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I know why birds sit on telephone lines. They listen.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I am either nine or ten years old. At the orphanage they call me Miguel.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; When I want to feel important, I say, "Call me Don Miguel."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I used to act important all the time because I felt I wasn't.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Back then, no one liked me very much because I didn't like other people.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; But last year, I began to learn two important things: I was learning to see, not just look. And I was learning to listen, not just hear.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I used to lie in the dark and make up relatives that I didn't have. My favorite relative was a nice old man who spoke Spanish, like me.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; One day a man came to see me. He said he was my uncle.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't have an uncle," I said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now you do," he said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; He was an old man who liked children. He had a boy once who went to Korea. His daughter moved to the City. He said the City can be a difficult place in which to live. He taught me how to see and listen. I don't know if he is my uncle or not; neither did he, but he came to see me often. I guess if you act like an uncle all the time, you are one.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I was not a good student before my uncle came along. He took me walking in the fields. At one point he spread his arms and said, "It is all here."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "What?" I said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Everything you need to know," he replied.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; At first it appeared to be nothing more than just a few trees. I thought I was nowhere. Then he had me close my eyes. First I heard the breeze in the grass, then in the trees. I also heard a faraway train and a barking dog. For a while I heard nothing. I was almost scared. He said to listen harder.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard my heart beat.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I used to be so sad, I had almost forgotten that I had a heart.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Once I asked him who he was.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "An experiment," he said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "What kind of an experiment?" I said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; He grinned and said, "Nobody knows. Like you, there is no one in the world like me. So who is to say what I will be."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; One day in the field he showed me the way the breeze made the trees move. The rustling of the leaves made a sound that frightened a nearby bird. It flew away.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; We watched the bird drop an acorn.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "The bird," he said, "can make a seed move. From that seed the oak can grow fifty feet tall. It will be a friend to those who want one."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I always knew that trees were there, but I never knew they were real like me.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; One Sunday I was angry. When my uncle came, I said: "I don't have anything. I wish I had something."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "You have everything worth having," he said. "And I will give you even more. I will give some secrets of the Universe. Do you believe me?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," I said, wanting to believe him.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave me three small seeds.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Put each seed into a small box filled with dirt. Then care for them. Talk to them if you wish. They will grow with you."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Now they are in larger boxes. One of the plants has grown up to my knee. I sometimes wonder what else it is up to.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Another time we were walking in the field when we saw two birds on a telephone line. They seemed so peaceful. Then suddenly they flew away. My uncle just laughed.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "See," he said. "Someone said something they didn't like. Be careful what you tell the birds."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; One night I passed by the office of the orphanage. A man I don't like very much was on the phone. He was angry and loud.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; When he left, I went into the office and picked up the phone. I heard the funniest sound.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Listen," I said. "Listen, birds. Come on back, never mind what he says. We like you."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; One day Uncle did not come. I waited and waited but he did not come. The man I don't like at the orphanage said Uncle was sick.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "May I go and see him?" I asked.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "No," he said. "He may be contagious."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "May I call him?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "No, " he said. "I'll call him for you."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Don't do that," I said.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why not?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "You'll make the birds fly away."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I sneaked into the office one night and called Uncle.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Are you all right?" I asked.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, but I must go away."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "To make room for something else."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Will you come back?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "I will help you remember me, if you want me to."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; "I do. ... I do. ..."
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; When I went to bed at night, I would try to imagine that he was there. He was harder and harder to see. One night, he was not there at all. There was only a green field.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I went back to our field. It was raining. The sky was dark, the way I was inside. I looked for Uncle everywhere. I called his name.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I was angry for a while. I said some things out loud that I shouldn't have said. Two birds flew out of the tree. I made them get wet.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; On the way back, I saw something that was only an inch or two tall. It was where that bird dropped the acorn. I didn't tell anybody, but I knew.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Someday Uncle will be fifty feet tall.
