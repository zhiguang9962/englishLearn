&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Once upon a time, there lived a woodman and his wife. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were very poor, and they lived in a cottage on the edge of a forest. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Every day, the woodman would set out early in the morning to chop down trees. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As the woodman was travelling through the forest one day, he saw a fine old oak tree. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "That will make plenty of planks," he thought, as he felt the blade of his axe to make sure it was sharp. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was about to strike the tree with the axe, when he heard someone crying out: "Please don't hurt this tree." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The woodman looked around him and saw a tiny fairy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "If you do not hurt this tree," she said, "I will grant you and your wife three wishes." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I won't hurt the tree," said the woodman kindly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then the fairy vanished! </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> That evening, the woodman walked slowly home. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was feeling very hungry and could not wait for his supper. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Is my supper ready?" the woodman asked his wife. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Not for at least two hours," replied his wife. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So the woodman sat in a chair by the fire. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I wish I had a big black sausage to eat right now," he said out loud. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And suddenly, a delicious sausage appeared on the table before him! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Why has that black sausage suddenly appeared?" the woodman's wife asked. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> So the woodman told his wife the story about the fairy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But his wife was very angry. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You have wasted the first of our wishes," she said crossly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "I wish that sausage were on your nose!" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And with that, the sausage jumped up and stuck fast on the woodman's nose. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His wife could not pull it off and nor could he, so the only thing to do was to wish it on the table again, which the woodman did. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What a waste of three wishes! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The only thing the woodman had was a good supper of black sausage. </T> <BR>
