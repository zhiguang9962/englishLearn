<T TYPE=SEN> POLICE INSPECTOR: Good evening, sir. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I understand that you have been robbed. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: I certainly have. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: When did this happen? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: About two hours ago. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: Why didn't you report it before? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: I couldn't. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was bound and gagged. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: Please tell me exactly what happened. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Without thinking, I opened it. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: That wasn't very wise, sir. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: I know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was expecting my wife, you see, and thought it was her. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: You should never open a door without looking to see who it is. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: Yes, I know. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I regret it very much. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: What happened? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: Two men pushed into the flat. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: Did you get a good look at them? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: I'm afraid not. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were both wearing stockings over their faces. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: What did they take? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: My wallet, with $200 in it, my wristwatch, some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom, and a silver photoframe. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> MR. LEE: No. They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They ran off then leaving me bound and gagged. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was some time before my wife returned and released me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I phoned the police at once. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> P.I.: My men began searching the area as soon as we received your call. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I can't promise you that we'll recover your property but we'll certainly do our best. </T> <BR>
