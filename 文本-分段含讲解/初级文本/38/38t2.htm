&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Charles Kent and Tony Smith are playing a game. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They are asking each other questions about general knowledge. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: When was America discovered, Tony? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TONY: I'm not certain. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Do you know? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TONY: In a way that's right. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But the Vikings travelled there long before Columbus. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And what about the Red Indians? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: All right. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ask me a question now. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TONY: Who invented the electric light bulb? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: That's easy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was invented by Edison. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TONY: Correct. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now for a harder question. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Who will be the first men on Mars? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: I can't answer that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I think Mars will be visited by men before the end of this century. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TONY: Ask me a question now. </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> CHARLES: All right. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What is the nearest planet to the sun? </T> <BR>
<T TYPE=SEN> TONY: That's easy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's ... er ... Venus. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No. Pluto. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No. Wait a minute. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's on the tip of my tongue. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Oh dear, what is the nearest planet to the sun? </T> <BR>
