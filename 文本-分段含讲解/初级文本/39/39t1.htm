&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It's hard being an astronaut's son. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean, everybody expects you to be special or perfect, and I'm just an average eleven-year-old kid. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I'm an average student, and I'm average, too, when it comes to basketball, football, soccer, and baseball. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I often wonder how my father ever had a son like me. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I mean he's so special and so good at everything he does. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In high school he was captain of the football team, class president, and editor of the school newspaper. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Well, to tell you the truth, I do have a little talent that nobody knows about. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I write poems and stories and keep them in a red notebook in my bottom desk drawer. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Nowadays I dream about being a famous writer, but I used to dream about doing something spectacular to impress my father and make him proud of me ¡ª</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> something like rescuing a child from a burning building or chasing a robber away from an old lady. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I was daydreaming in school one morning (which I do often). </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was daydreaming about being some kind of hero, like discovering an instant cure for cancer or a shot for mental illness, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> when I heard my English teacher announce a Father's Day essay contest for the whole school. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I hope we have a winner right here in my English class," she said. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The PTA has donated three cash prizes ¡ª one hundred dollars for first prize, fifty dollars for second, and twenty-five dollars for third prize." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After school I walked home, thinking about the essay I would write. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> <I>My father is an astronaut,</I> I would start out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> No, I decided. I wouldn't do that. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The whole country and maybe even the whole world saw my father as an astronaut, but that wasn't the way I saw him. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When I got home, I kissed my mom quickly. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then I went upstairs to my room and sat down with a pen and a pad of paper. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I started to think about what I would write. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> How did I see my father. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Hmm. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I saw him sitting with me in the dark when I was a little kid and had a nightmare. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I saw him teaching me how to use a bat and how to throw a baseball. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I remembered how he hugged me for hours when my dog Spotty was hit and killed by a car. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And I remembered how he surprised me with a new puppy at my eighth birthday party. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I started to cry, he told all the kids that I had a bad allergy. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "David's allergy bothers him a lot this time of year," Dad said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And I remembered how he sat and tried to explain death to me when Grandpa Bob died. </T>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These were the things I was going to write about my dad. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> To me, he wasn't just a world-famous astronaut. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was my dad. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I wrote about all these memories and put them in my essay. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I handed it in the next day and was surprised to find out that the winning essays would be read in the auditorium on Thursday night. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All the parents and students were invited. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My parents and I went to school Thursday night. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of our neighbours said, "I bet you'll win the contest, David. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I bet you wrote what it's like to be the son of an astronaut, and you're the only one in town who could write about that." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My dad looked at me, and I shrugged. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I hadn't shown him the essay, and now I almost hoped I wouldn't win. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I didn't want to win just because my father was an astronaut. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When third prize was announced and it wasn't me, I was relieved and disappointed at the same time, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ellen Gordon won third prize, and she read her essay. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ellen is adopted, and she wrote about her "better than real" father. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she got to the end, I heard people in the audience sniffing and blowing their noses. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My mother sniffed, and my father cleared his throat. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The second-prize winner was announced next. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was me. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I went up to the stage, my knees shaking. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I read my essay and wondered if my voice was shaking, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It was scary standing up in front of all those people. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I called my essay "My Father's Son". </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I watched my parents as I read. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When I finished reading, the audience applauded. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I saw my father blowing his nose. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Tears were running down my mother's face. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I went back to my seat. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I see you have an allergy, too, Dad," I tried to joke. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dad nodded, cleared his throat, and put his hand on my shoulder. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Son, this is the proudest moment of my life," he said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It was the proudest moment of my life, too. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Maybe I'll never be a great hero or win a Nobel Prize, but just then, it was enough just to be my father's son. </T> <BR>
