&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Brown's old grandfather lived with her and her husband. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Every morning he went for a walk in the park and came home at half past twelve for his lunch. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But one morning a police car stopped outside Mrs. Brown's house at twelve o'clock, and two policemen helped Mr. Brown to get out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One of them said to Mrs. Brown, "The poor old gentleman lost his way in the park and telephoned to us for help, so we sent a car to bring him home." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Brown was very surprised, but she thanked the policemen and they left. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But, Grandfather," she then said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "you have been to that park nearly every day for twenty years. How did you lose your way there?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The old man smiled, closed one eye and said, "I didn't quite lose my way. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I just got tired and I didn't want to walk home!" </T> <BR>
