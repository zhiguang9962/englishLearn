<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; We say that a person has good manners if he or she behaves politely and is kind and helpful to others. Everyone likes a person with good manners but no one likes a person with bad manners. "Yes," you may say, "but what are good manners? How does one know what to do and what not to do?"
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, here are some examples of the things that a well-mannered person does or does not do.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; He never laughs at people when they are in trouble. Instead, he tries to help them. He is always kind, never cruel, to people. When people are waiting for a bus, or in a post office, he takes his turn. He does not push to the front line of the queue. In the bus he gives his seat to an older person or a lady who is standing. If he accidentally bumps into someone, or gets in their way, he says "Excuse me" or "I'm sorry".
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; He says "Please" when he makes a request, and "Thank you" when he receives something. He stands up when he is speaking to a lady or an older person, he does not sit down until the other person is seated. He does not interrupt other people when they are talking. He does not talk too much himself. He does not talk loudly or laugh loudly in public. When he is eating he does not speak with his mouth full of food. He uses a handkerchief when he sneezes or coughs.
