&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mary wanted to be a nurse when she left school, but in the meantime, she joined the Red Cross and had some limited training. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She was taught that, in case of an accident ¡ª and they were plentiful in her town ¡ª she should give first aid at once and then send for a doctor. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One day, there was an accident in a busy street, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and when Mary arrived soon after, she saw a man bending over a woman who had been accidentally knocked down by a car and was lying motionless in the street. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mary ran up, pushed the man away, informed the crowd that she was a Red Cross nurse and began to help the wounded woman. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After a few minutes, the man who had been bending over the woman when Mary arrived touched her on the shoulder and said, </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "When you reach the part about sending for a doctor, don't worry. I'm here already." </T> <BR>
