&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Williams lived in a small street in London, and now she had a new neighbour. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her name was Mrs. Briggs, and she talked a lot about her expensive furniture, her beautiful carpets and her new kitchen. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Do you know," she said to Mrs. Williams one day, "I've got a new dishwasher. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It washes the plates and glasses and knives and forks beautifully." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh?" Mrs. Williams answered. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "And does it dry them and put them in the cupboard too?" </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Briggs was surprised. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Well," she answered, "the things in the machine are dry after an hour, but it doesn't put them away, of course." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I've had a dishwasher for twelve and a half years," Mrs. Williams said. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Oh?" Mrs. Briggs answered. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "And does yours put the things in the cupboard when it has washed them?" She laughed nastily. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Yes, he does," Mrs. Williams answered. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "He dries the dishes and puts them away." </T> <BR>
