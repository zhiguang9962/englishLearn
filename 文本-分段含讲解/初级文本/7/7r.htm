<P align=center><B>A Better Mailman</B></P><BR>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; I worked as a mailman for a short time. However, I am afraid of dogs and I had a lot of trouble. One day I tried to deliver some letters to a big house. I started to open the gate and all of a sudden a huge dog ran toward me. It growled and barked at me, so I threw the letters over the fence. The dog picked them up and carried them into the house. The dog was a better mailman than I was!
