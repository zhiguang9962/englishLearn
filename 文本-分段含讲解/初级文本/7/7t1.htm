&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One night there was a heavy snowstorm, and in the morning Mr. Smith's garden was full of deep snow. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith wanted to take his car out, so he paid a man to clean the path from his garage to his gate. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He said to this man, "Don't throw any snow on that side, because it will damage the bushes in my garden; and don't throw any snow into the street, or the police will be angry." </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then Mr. Smith went out. </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When he came back, the path was clean and the snow from it was not on the bushes, or the fence, or the street. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Smith was very pleased ¡ª until he opened the garage to get his car out! </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The garage was full to the top with all the snow from the path, and his car was somewhere under it all! </T> <BR>
