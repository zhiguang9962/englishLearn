<T TYPE=SEN> "I wish this weren't the last night of our camping trip, but school starts next week." </T> <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A couple of days after returning home, Lloyd and Fred took the exposed film out of their camera and took it to the camera shop to be developed. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were told that the pictures would be ready Thursday. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Thursday was just two days away. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Fred and Lloyd could hardly wait to see how their pictures came out. </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They planned to show their pictures to everyone at school as soon as school was back in session. </T> <BR>
