<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Education Is about Something More Important</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Yes, but what is education about? Is it really about facts and figures, learning things by heart ¡ª you know, the three "r's" reading, writing and arithmetic (and that shows somebody can't spell, doesn't it?) No, it gets me really cross. People criticize modern education because some kids don't know their seven times table. Hell, what does that matter in the age of computers and calculators? No, education is about something much more important. It's about teaching people how to live, how to get on with one another, how to form relationships. It's about understanding things, not just knowing them. O.K. seven sevens are forty-nine. But what does that mean? It's not just a formula, you know. I want my kids to understand.<BR>
