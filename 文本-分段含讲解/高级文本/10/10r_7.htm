&nbsp; &nbsp;     The realization of China's modernization relies on the children of today.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Childhood is a time of physical and mental development, so efforts must be made to provide an ideal environment for their development, encouraging intellectual, physical and moral training.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     How should our children be trained to cope wisely in the future? We should provide them with a good material life, but more importantly, a good spiritual life. Patriotism and communism must be spread among children to stimulate lofty ideals and hard work to enliven the Chinese nation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     China needs talent that has developed morally, intellectually and physically. The practice of only enabling people who receive an education to develop intellectually could result in a <T TYPE=HOT>deficiency</T> on the part of a generation of children.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     We have to put right the tendency of stressing only intelligence and ignoring moral and physical education and necessary physical work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Instead of children only receiving a classroom book-learning education, we should encourage them to mingle with society and nature so that they can be more adaptable in society.<BR>
