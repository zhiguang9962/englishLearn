<P ALIGN=center><B>9. The Modern Methods Have Gone Wrong</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Well, if you asked me, it's all these modern methods that's the problem. In the old days you sat in rows at desks and you did as you were told. You knew what you had to do and you did it ¡ª and you kept quiet. Nowadays, my god, the noise in most schools is deafening especially primary schools. The children wander around ¡ª do more or less what they want to as far as I can see. The teacher just sits there or wanders around with them, talking to them. Informal teaching they call it. Discovery methods. Sounds more like a recipe for discovering disaster to me. When do they have time to learn anything? Too busy wandering about to do any work. And when you look at the youngsters coming to work for me, you soon find out they haven't learnt very much at all.<BR>
