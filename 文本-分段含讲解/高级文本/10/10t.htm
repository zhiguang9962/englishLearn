&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> During my recent tour to Kunming in Yunnan Province, I encountered a young Australian at Liuzhou railway station.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I helped him get on board the train with his luggage, and we got to chatting in English.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I learned that he was 21 years old, studying Asian literature and history at Sydney University.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> What surprised me was that, young as he was, he had travelled a lot, not only in China but also in many other parts of Asia,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and he seemed to know so much about the Asian culture and history, and was even familiar with ancient and modern Chinese literature and philosophy masters such as Confucius, Lu Xun, Mao Dun and Guo Moruo.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could speak four languages.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He is a college student, but he did not confine himself to classroom reading only.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He said if one really wants to know the society and the world, he or she should go to the grassroots to see, hear and find out about real life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Besides, many students like him in Australia work at part-time jobs after class so as to earn a living and save enough for travelling.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I am a bit older than he is.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Yet I found myself less knowledgeable than he is about many things in the world.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Like some of my classmates at college, I often feel conceited for merely being a college student and sometimes I even looked down upon those who failed to enter college.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We didn't have to work to earn a living, and took many things for granted.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We should not just admire other people's living standard and opportunities.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What we should do is to learn their spirit of self-reliance as well as a sense of responsibility for the society they live in.</T>
