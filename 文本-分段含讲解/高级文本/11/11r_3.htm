<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Parental Piety Is Taken to Extremes</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The dictionary defines "<T TYPE=HOT>filial</T> piety" as "a son's or daughter's obedience to and respect for parents". It is a pity that in reality the implication of this expression has changed in China, a nation so proud of this virtue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It so happened in a department store that an old couple, after careful selection and much hesitation, <T TYPE=HOT>fumbled</T> 600 <I>yuan</I> from their pockets for a quality down quilt, smiling with content when the package was handed over the counter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "It's so good to see the elderly spend their savings for their own sake. There aren't many old people who buy expensive commodities for themselves these days," commented a middle-aged passer-by.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "We really should be a bit <T TYPE=HOT>hedonistic</T>, shouldn't we?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The old couple's smile froze on hearing the words. "It's actually for my youngest son. He's getting married soon," sighed the old man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The passer-by nodded understandingly, "Show filial piety to your son, eh?" she said half jokingly. Her words were greeted by a fit of hollow laughter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     This role reversal - piety to one's children - is not uncommon, in rural areas and cities alike.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Parents save every penny for a child to enter a self-paid college if he or she fails university entrance exams. They empty their pockets for a son or daughter's wedding. They do all the household chores for a child living together with them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Without exaggeration, Chinese parents are the most thoughtful and considerate of parents in the world. Just visit an amusement park on Sunday and you will see how true this statement is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When Chinese parents, or grandparents, accompany their children to amusement parks, rarely do they ride the roller coaster or the wonder wheel; not because they are too timid, but because they are simply too busy queuing up for their children.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In much the same way, they would sacrifice their own interests for the happiness of their offspring.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A 1990 survey in Bengbu, Anhui Province, found 62 per cent of the younger families owned colour TV sets, compared with 23 per cent in older families.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     While 61 per cent of younger families possessed refrigerators and 80 per cent had washing machines, relevant percentages from the older families were 19 and 35.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Apart from the older generation's habitual thriftiness, the survey said the aged spend much income on their children. Their savings were further diminished by entertaining their extended families on holiday.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Tianjin, a survey of 100 newly-weds found expenditure for the occasion averaged 11,380 <I>yuan</I> ($2,147). Among them, 93 per cent were "sponsored" by parents, partially or totally.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     That explains, to a large degree, why the homes of most Chinese parents are rather plain, with furniture bought in the 1950s and 1960s.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In sharp contrast, the homes of young couples display matching furniture, video cassettes and audio systems. Their houses are usually carpeted and decorated with wallpaper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When young people do not have houses of their own upon marriage, their parents readily give up the best space in the house, and retreat to smaller north-facing rooms.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When grandchildren are born, many grandparents volunteer to be baby-sitters, caring for and bringing up the third generation without complaint.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     This "piety" towards sons and daughters is very moving indeed. But I can't help thinking that it is more natural for children to leave their parents and live on their own as is the practice in other countries.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In this way, children can better develop the habit of working and living independently. The older generation, on the other hand, can enjoy their later years in a more relaxed way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Occasionally, parents may extend financial help to their children if the latter are really in need of it. But they need not lavish care on their grown-up children. It is the children who should practise the virtue of being filial to their old parents. In this way, society would follow a more healthy path of development.<BR>
