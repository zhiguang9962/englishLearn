<P align=center><B><T TYPE=SEN>Who Is to Blame, Mimi, or Her Parents?</T></B></P><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> I always thought Xiao Hong a spoilt and wilful child, but today I met a girl a hundred times worse.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Compared to her, Xiao Hong is an angel!</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Uncle and Aunt Liu came for a visit and brought their darling girl Mimi with them, a girl of five and their only child.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The first sight of her disgusted me.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was dressed and made up like nothing on earth.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I always hated the sight of Xiao Hong when she got all painted up on Children's Day or on other festive occasions.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But this Mimi was painted up for no reasons at all.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And even worse, she had her hair permed too.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's bad enough to see grown-up women perm their hair into all sorts of shapes and styles ¡ª haysacks, loosewires, bird-nests, cock-tails, name what you will, but it's their own funeral.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If they want to abuse and spoil their own hair, they are welcome to it, but to do it to their children is really awful.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As though that's not enough, the Lius had Mimi's ears pricked too in order that she may wear ear-rings ...</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What next?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They would have her feet bound too if foot-binding should suddenly become fashionable.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The way she was made up, bad as it was, was nothing compared with the way she behaved.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When Mum offered her some sweets, she grabbed two handfuls, and refused to say a "Thank you!" when gently reminded by her mother.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Dear girl! She is always shy before strangers and forgets her manners!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What a bare-faced lie!</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> By no stretch of imagination could Mimi be described as a shy girl.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Anyway I don't think she has had any manners to forget.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she played with Xiao Hong's things, her only pleasure seemed to lie in destruction.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she started to tear up Xiao Hong's picture books, it was really too much and Xiao Hong tried to rescue what remained by snatching them away.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Obviously Mimi had never been crossed by anyone like this before and she started to howl like a pig being killed.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her parents rushed up to her, as though their darling daughter was in mortal danger.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Horrid Xiao Hong! Spank her! Spank her!" Mimi kept screaming.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Without finding out what it was all about, and without a single word of reprimand, the Lius were all out to mollify her.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "There, there, don't cry my precious! Auntie will spank her later!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But Mimi was not so easily mollified.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "No, no! Mammy spank her now!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her mother really went up to Xiao Hong and clapped her hands behind Xiao Hong's back, pretending to be spanking: "See if you dare to make Mimi cry again!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This sort of farce went on and on.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Lunch was an even more hectic affair, either because she had too many sweets in her or she was over-nourished anyway, she just refused to eat anything.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All the same she insisted on having all the best dishes in front of her and dipped her spoon into every one of them at will,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> while all the time her parents, one on each side of her, tried their best to spoon-feed her.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They coaxed and cajoled, and for every occasional mouthful Mimi took, they cheered and praised as though it was a remarkable feat by their darling daughter.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They expected cheers and praises from us too.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> More often than not, Mimi would spit out what she had just taken, and the table was littered with her spilt and spat out food.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She spoiled the whole meal for everybody.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> At last we had a moment of peace and quiet when Mimi dozed off after the meal.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it was only a lull before another storm.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When the Lius tried gently to wake her in order to leave, she got into a tantrum because they had disturbed her sleep, and she kept raining blows on her father all the way he carried her downstairs.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Serves him damn well right, I said to myself in secret delight.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At last Mimi was doing something with my full approval.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I would love her even more if she did the same to her mother.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When the door finally closed on them, Mum and Dad looked at each other and burst out laughing.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Soon we were all laughing.</T>
