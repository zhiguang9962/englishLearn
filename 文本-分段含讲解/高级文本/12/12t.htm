<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Today we had an American family, the Robinsons, for Sunday dinner.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The man is in China on a joint project with the department where Mum works.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They work in the same office and as Mum knows a little English she often interprets for him too, so they got to know each other very well.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had often expressed his wish of meeting her family, but Mum hardly dared to invite him to our old slum of a place.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now that we've moved to our new apartment we have a more or less presentable place to entertain him and his family.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Granny was the only one who had any misgivings about having "high-nosed foreigners" in our house.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They came about twelve ¡ª Mr. and Mrs. Robinson and their two young daughters about Xiao Hong's age.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Robinson gave Mum a bunch of fresh flowers, bringing colour, freshness and their good will.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mum did the introduction and it was left to ourselves to get to know each other.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As was natural Xiao Hong soon got on very well with the two girls Judy and Annie.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They all had a common love for Xiao Hong's little kitten and they had endless fun with it.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Robinson was much younger than her husband, but she was friendly and kindly and knows a little Chinese.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was a moment of embarrassment when Granny asked her age.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mum was about to apologize when Mrs. Robinson laughed and said it was quite all right, that she had been here long enough to know it was the Chinese custom.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She quite blandly told us that she was thirty-two, almost twenty years her husband's junior.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When they learned that Mum was almost ten years her senior, they were genuinely surprised, for Mum does look quite young.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "No wonder you are so good and experienced at your work. I had thought you were fresh from college!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Robinson said, perhaps a little flatteringly.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> And of course they thoroughly enjoyed the dinner.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Like a perfect Chinese hostess Mum and especially Granny kept stuffing them with food and urging them to eat and to drink, apologizing all the time that "it's all very meager and coarse fare."</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The Robinsons, on the other hand, were loud in their praises and protestations.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We used to hear about Chinese hospitality and now we know what it's really like.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> How can you describe such a lavish meal as meager and coarse?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Any hostess in the West would be proud of such a feast instead of apologizing for it,"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mrs. Robinson said to Mum.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "And another thing we don't do in the West is to urge the guests to eat and drink," Mr. Robinson added.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "With so much good things before me I certainly don't need any urging.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The problem is rather how to prevent myself from over-eating!</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But back at home I often had to ask for a second helping and my hostess would feel flattered that I should want more of her stuff.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Here you don't even give me a chance to ask for more!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We all burst out laughing at that.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When they rose to leave they thanked us profusely not only for the excellent dinner, but for giving them such a nice time.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Living in Friendship Hotel isn't really living in China.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Today we feel we are really in China.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We've learnt much more about the Chinese people and Chinese way of life today than half a year in the Friendship Hotel.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You must all come to visit us one day.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Or better still, come and see us in the States one day."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Judy and Annie were reluctant to go.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They made Xiao Hong promise to visit them at Friendship Hotel, telling her not to forget bringing the kitten with her!</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They insisted on giving everyone of us a hug and a kiss, which quite embarrassed me.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I think Granny was really touched when they kissed her.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All her misgivings had been dispelled.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It's surprising how a little good will on both sides can break language and cultural barriers.</T>
