<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Why Work?</B></P><BR>
Matthew: Michael, do you go out to work?<BR>
Michael: Not regularly, no. I ... I used to; I used to have a job in a publishing company, but I decided it wasn't really what I wanted to do and that what I wanted to do wouldn't earn me much money, so I gave up working and luckily I had a private income from my family to support me and now I do the things I want to do. Some of them get paid like lecturing and teaching, and others don't.<BR>
Matthew: What are the advantages of not having to go to work from nine till five?<BR>
Michael: Ah ... there're ... there're two advantages really. One is that if you feel tired you don't have to get up, and the other is that you can spend your time doing things you want to do rather than being forced to do the same thing all the time.<BR>
Matthew: But surely that's in a sense very self-indulgent and very lucky because most of us have to go out and earn our ... our livings ... um. Do you feel justified in having this privileged position?<BR>
Michael: Yes, because I think I use it well. I do things which I think are useful to people and the community and which I enjoy doing.<BR>
Matthew: Joan, do you think that in order to lead a balanced life, people need some form of work?<BR>
Joan: Yes, I do, but I think it's equally important that their attitude to work ... um ... should be positive. If one is going to look on work as drudgery, something that one does so that one will enjoy one's leisure or whatever comes after it, then ... then I don't think there... there can be very much satisfaction in it. But it seems to me that whatever work one is actually doing ... er ... can become creative, and I think that this is what we all need to feel that we are creating something, in the same way that even when er ... a mother cooks a meal, she is creating, in her own way, something which ... which is very necessary to her family.<BR>
