<P align=center><B><T TYPE=SEN>What Does Work Mean to People?</T></B></P><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A group of people from different walks of life are being interviewed about what role work plays in their lives.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Their attitudes, as we can see, vary.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: Mr. Fisher, you are an accountant and earn a good enough salary to enable you to live comfortably.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What does your work mean to you?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Fisher: I regard it as a means to an end.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Basically I'm a family man, and as long as I have a job which enables me to earn enough money to live well, I'm happy.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I find a comfortable life compensates for the fact that I have a routine life and three weeks holiday per year.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: So in fact, you don't really mind what you do for a living?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Fisher: I didn't say that.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I wouldn't want to be a manual worker, for instance.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I enjoy my profession up to a point, but it certainly doesn't rule my life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As soon as I get home I forget about the office.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I suppose you could say I work to live.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: Miss Burnes ！ as a school teacher in a working class area of London, how do you feel about Mr. Fisher's attitude towards his work?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Miss Burnes: Personally, I couldn't work to live.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I must enjoy whatever I do ！ even if the salary is low ！ otherwise I feel it isn't worth doing.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Fisher: Of course Miss Burnes, you do have long holidays which must be a great compensation.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Also, you aren't married and therefore have no family responsibilities ...</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Miss Burnes: Being single has nothing to do with it!</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even if I were married I'd still have to have a fulfilling profession.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: In other words, Miss Burnes, work plays one of the most important roles in your life?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Miss Burnes: Definitely! It gives me the mental satisfaction I need and a role in society.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Contrary to Mr. Fisher, I can say that I live to work.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: Of course, Mr. Fisher is employed by a company and Miss Burnes by a school and therefore both have a certain amount of guaranteed security.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans' "history" is unusual.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At the age of forty he gave up a good job in industry to do what he had always wanted to do ！ become a journalist and photographer.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He's self-employed and does freelance work.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans, do you have any regrets?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans: Yes ！ one.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That is that I didn't resign from my other job when I was younger!</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: What made you leave the business world?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans: Well ！ although I had a good salary and a job which involved a lot of travelling abroad, I always felt I was in the wrong job.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I felt tense all the time and I suddenly realized that, in spite of security and what seemed to my friends to be an exciting job, I'd stopped enjoying simple but important things ...</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Fisher: Don't you consider your choice rather selfish?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What about your wife and family?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans: They're delighted.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They see the change in me ！ find me more relaxed, and therefore my relationship with my wife and family has improved, because I'm not frustrated any more.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's because I'm doing what I want to do.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Interviewer: Do you work as hard as before?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans: Yes ！ even harder.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But I'm self-disciplined and I find that working hard for a few hours gives me time to play hard too.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I have a more balanced life.</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Miss Burnes: So in fact, you too have a routine life?</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans: Of course! Everything becomes routine after a while.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But it's up to us to make that routine a creative experience ！</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Miss Burnes: Oh yes ！ I do agree!</T>
<BR><T TYPE=SEN> Mr. Evans: And we mustn't forget that "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" ...</T>
