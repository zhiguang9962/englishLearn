<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Problems of the Young</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     More than 20 Chinese and American experts discovered that young people of both countries are facing the same problems of economic and social pressures and lack of confidence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wayne Meisel, director of the Campus Outreach Opportunity League of Minnesota University, said that under economic pressure American young people have to work hard and most students have to take part-time work in order to support themselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Young people today," he said, "are stereotyped as <T TYPE=HOT>apathetic</T>, self-centred, and concerned only with making money and getting ahead."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In these circumstances, he said, young people lack confidence, which was not the case in the 1960s when young Americans thought themselves capable of doing anything.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In spite of the different conditions in China, Li Xuequan, director of the higher education section of the All-China Youth Federation, said Chinese young people are also facing economic pressure and are worried about inflation and corruption.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Trading has appeared in many Chinese universities as students with something to sell try to make money on campus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Moreover, Li said, college students have begun to doubt whether what they are learning in class will help them find work, as many businesses totally ignore students of pure theory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     So people describe students as "a lost generation tired of study", regardless of the causes in society that are shaking their confidence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In order to resolve these problems, the Chinese and American experts agreed that youth organizations should call on the whole of society to create favourable conditions for the healthy growth of young people, as well as to encourage them to meet the urgent needs of society and to challenge the assumption that young people are apathetic and uncaring.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Meisel said that since last year he has sent letters of "challenge to youth" to many young people, urging them to commit themselves to addressing such needs as feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, educating the illiterate, consoling the lonely and sick, serving the elderly, and preserving the environment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The letter says: "Through service, we touch the lives of others and enrich our own." <BR>
