&nbsp; &nbsp;     More than 16 per cent of Chinese college and middle school students have emotional problems caused by concern over exams, poor relationships with their teachers and a lack of enthusiasm for their studies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Some students feel depressed, fearing they fall short of their parents' expectations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     An unhappy family life can also lead to depression.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     These conclusions are the result of research into emotional problems among college and middle school students.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     According to a study of 2,961 urban and rural college and middle school students, problems arise most frequently in two groups: students in their first and second year of junior middle schools and those in their last year at senior middle school or the first year in higher-learning institutions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The survey also revealed that emotional problems increase as students get older.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The percentage of students with emotional problems in junior middle schools is around 13 per cent, while the figures for students in senior middle school and higher-learning institutions are 19 and 25 per cent respectively.<BR>
