<P ALIGN=center><B>5. A Room of One's Own</B></P><BR>
A: Have you ever ... you know ... sort of ... Mum's said to you, like, Could you help me clear up? So you say, Yes, O.K. and you put your brother's or sister's things away, and then they come up and they say, Where's so and so? (Yeah ... Yes) But then you think to yourself, Well, it's annoying to have ... to have ... to leave somebody's coat or something in the middle of the room ... (Yes ... Yes, I know ...) Do you know what I mean?<BR>
B: And when they do complain, you feel as if you haven't done your job, but then you say, Well, I did pack it away, didn't I? ...You know ... what are they complaining about?<BR>
D: It's annoying as well ...<BR>
E: I do the same ... I mean if I find anything lying around ... if it's no good I just throw it away ...<BR>
A: It might mean a lot ...<BR>
D: I think in my family ... I think my mother is the most considerate ... she'd ask rather than my father ... my father wouldn't.<BR>
A: Well, I'm lucky ... I've got a room of my own ... so ...<BR>
D: I'd like a room of my own, but then again, you don't keep everything in your room, do you? My dad or mother goes in there and finds anything that she doesn't think is necessary ... my mother would ask me first, but my dad ...<BR>
B: Well, frankly, my mother wouldn't touch anything in my room, you know ... she just doesn't. She feels I've put it there for some purpose ... but again, if I go into her bedroom ...(Yeah ... That annoys me ...) But say if I have a day off from school ... or when ... or we've got some sort of holiday and I see things around and I say, well, you know, I'll give the place a good old clean, at least it'll help ... and I put things neatly, it's all tidy ... I wouldn't throw anything out, because I'm not sure whether she wants it or not ... and then she comes home, she says, Where's this? where's that? ... I feel awful ...<BR>
D: And you feel that ... um ... she doesn't appreciate ...<BR>
B: ... appreciate, you know ... I even the other day moved her bedroom ... er ... (Furniture) ... furniture around.<BR>
D: I did that in my house ...<BR>
B: I did ... I thought it looked awful where it was, you know.<BR>
A: But I ... what annoys me is my room...is my room ... If ... if it's in a muddle I know where everything is ... I like my room to be in a mess.<BR>
B: But you see, we ... I keep that as a sort of main bedroom, you know ... (main room ...)Yes, sometimes I don't even sleep in my room, it's so cold. ...<BR>
C: Ooh, crumbs!<BR>
B: How do you feel on this subject, Pamels?<BR>
D: [with a great <T TYPE=HOT>guffaw</T>] Negative!<BR>
C: I always know where everything is in my room even if it is untidy, but my mother comes along and I can't find anything anywhere.<BR>
A: I like it when you get to that age where your parents seem to realize that you're...you're going off on your own ... (Yes ... You're growing up ...) ... you've got your own life to lead, so you think, Right, we'll leave all her things, she can do what she likes with them. It's her time, she can do what she likes with her time.<BR>
B: They start from a certain point, don't they?<BR>
E: Well, I don't think they always do that ... They try to remember that you're growing up and then they forget.<BR>
D: Yes ... they try to protect you ...<BR>
E: They're treating you like children and telling you where to put things ...<BR>
C: ... going round tidying up after you.<BR>
