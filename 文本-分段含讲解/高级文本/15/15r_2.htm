<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Is Smoking a Bad Habit?</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I, a casual smoker, always wonder if smoking is really a bad habit. If it is, why does our country produce such a large number of cigarettes every year? (As you know, China is the largest cigarette producing country in the world.) If it is, why do so many girls admire handsome boys with a cigarette on their lip?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     My friends tell me, "Smoking is a waste of money, a cause of disease ..." Admittedly, these reasons frighten some people into giving up smoking, but can you ensure that non-smokers will live long without dying in an <T TYPE=HOT>epidemic</T> or getting killed by a drunken driver? Can you say it is not a waste of money for most non-smokers habitually to spend a lot of money on snacks?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In my opinion, smoking is only an amusement, like playing cards, reading, etc. Many years ago, when an adult handed me a cigarette and lit it for me, I felt grown up. When I am with friends and have nothing to say, we smoke, consequently we no longer feel embarrassed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Sometimes, I light a cigarette, watching my loneliness, suffering and nervousness vanishing with the smoke, I can't help saying inwardly: Hello, cigarette, my old friend, I'm coming to meet you again.<BR>
