<P ALIGN=center><B>5. On Smoking - Its History and Harm</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Tobacco smoking is believed to have started in Central and South America. Nearly 500 years ago explorers who went there with Columbus brought back to Europe the habit of pipe smoking, which they had learned from the New World Indians. It was introduced into China from Luson during the Ming dynasty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Until the 1900's tobacco was used mainly for cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco and snuff. Cigarettes may first have been made by the Aztecs of Mexico. They smoked shredded tobacco rolled in corn husk covering. Cigarette smoking gained some popularity in Europe during the 1800's. It increased sharply after World War I and again after World War ¢ò.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     For centuries the smoking of tobacco in cigarettes, cigars and pipes has produced controversy over possible health hazards. Scientific investigations of smoking and health gained <T TYPE=HOT>impetus</T> after the beginning of the 20th century, when an increase in lung cancer was noted. But only since the 1950's has sufficient scientific evidence accumulated to make possible a thorough evaluation of the health risk. Although some gaps in knowledge still exist, the information now available is sufficient to permit making sound judgements.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Since cigarettes have steadily become more popular than cigars and pipes, investigators have directed their principal consideration to cigarette smoking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As we now know, tobacco contains an organic <T TYPE=HOT>compound</T> - nicotine. It is the principal <T TYPE=HOT>alkaloid</T> of tobacco, occurring throughout the plant. Nicotine, one of the many substances <T TYPE=HOT>pharmacologically</T> active in tobacco smoke, exerts an effect on the heart and nervous system in particular. The effect on the nervous system is predominantly tranquilizing and relaxing. There is little doubt that the physiological effects strengthen the habit. So for centuries, some people <T TYPE=HOT>obstinately</T> believed tobacco smoking possessed medicinal properties. It reduced tension and was pleasurable. But in reality, it has turned out to be tragedy. When you smoke, you're breathing in close to a gram of dirty brown <T TYPE=HOT>tar</T> a day. Even the smoking of only a few cigarettes a day causes many dangerous <T TYPE=HOT>ailments</T>. An American scientist estimated that smokers who average a package a day for 20 years will lose about eight years of their lives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Along with the increase in cigarette smoking, many scientific investigations have been undertaken. Overwhelming evidence proves the danger and harm of smoking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Experimental, clinical-pathological, and epidemiological evidence indicates that cigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer. The risk of developing lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the duration of the smoking habit, and it diminishes with the cessation of smoking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Cigarette smoking was also found to be connected with other types of cancer. It is considered a major factor in causing cancer of the <T TYPE=HOT>larynx</T> and is associated with cancer of the <T TYPE=HOT>esophagus</T>. Smoking is a significant factor in the development of oral cancer, and pipe smoking alone or with other tobacco use, is causally related to lip cancer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Cigarette smoking is the greatest cause of <T TYPE=HOT>chronic bronchitis</T>. A person suffering from chronic bronchitis may have the disease and the cough connected with it, for many years, perhaps for the rest of his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Cigarette smoking has also been found to be connected with <T TYPE=HOT>pulmonary emphysema</T>, a disabling disease of the lungs. The smoking of cigarettes increases the risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and from pulmonary emphysema.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Smoking is associated with coronary heart disease. Nowadays this disease accounts for a high percentage of deaths annually. Cigarette smokers are much more likely to die from a heart attack than non-smokers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Smoking injures blood vessels, speeds up hardening of the arteries and increases the work of the heart. It is one of the factors contributing to high blood pressure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     What little we've mentioned above is sufficient to show that smoking is extremely harmful to health. Most people throughout the world have come to realize the danger. Nowadays some governments are taking practical measures against smoking. We sincerely advise those who have formed the smoking habit to stop and those who haven't yet started not to. It is both for your own sake and for the sake of the next generation. A recent survey report says that children exposed to parental cigarette smoke may be put at a higher risk of developing lung disease later in their lives. Passive exposure to smoke may also interfere with normal lung growth in young children. There is a strong association between parental smoking and children's pulmonary function. Children who recorded the weakest lung function were found to be smokers themselves and to have parents or brothers and sisters who smoked. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     So let us join together to launch a mass movement to break this harmful smoking habit, and build ourselves up, healthy and strong, to work hard for the four modernizations.<BR>
