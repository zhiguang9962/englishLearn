<P ALIGN=center><B>6. Call to Stop Offering Cigarettes!</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     To the Chinese, who claim to have invented rules of <T TYPE=HOT>etiquette</T>, offering cigarettes is a way of being hospitable to guests. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When somebody calls, first of all, the host would offer him a cigarette and a cup of tea. In the countryside, hospitable, old men often allow visiting guests to share the long-stemmed Chinese pipe which they themselves are smoking. At wedding ceremonies, brides would offer cigarettes to all guests who came to express their congratulations and light the cigarettes for each of them one after another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     All these were originally aimed at displaying the Chinese hospitality and respect towards the guests. But in recent years, the old tradition has been used as a means to nurse good relations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Even those who never smoke have brand-name cigarettes in their pockets. Whenever they have to seek somebody's favour, they first offer him a cigarette, If the other party turns it down, he is being impolite. If he accepts it he has to do something, for courtesy demands a favour in return.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Tobacco contains harmful substances. So offering cigarettes to somebody is equal to doing harm to him. But neither people who offer cigarettes nor those who take them fully realize it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is even more unhealthy for the host to pass the long-stemmed Chinese pipe or water pipe to the visitor after smoking it beforehand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Once I paid a visit to a relative who had just returned from abroad. He was smoking but did not produce one for me. Instead, he placed the cigarette packet on the table and told me: "Cigarettes produce carbon monoxide and nicotine. But if you don't mind this, take it yourself."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     His way of offering cigarettes was unique but worth learning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Many people throughout the world are attempting to quit smoking. But to give up the practice, firstly I think, we had better change the traditional method of entertaining guests.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Not to offer cigarettes does not mean one is inhospitable. The cigarette packet is on the table. If you cannot check your craving for one at the risk of your health, you may. But you will have to bear the consequences yourself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     You had better also bear in mind that while you are smoking and harming yourself, you are also polluting the air and hurting others.<BR>
