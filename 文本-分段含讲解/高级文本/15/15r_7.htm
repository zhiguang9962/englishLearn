<P ALIGN=center><B>7. Smoking Is a Bad Habit</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Smoking is a bad habit. Firstly, it ruins people's health. Health experts have warned us for years that smoking can lead to heart disease, lung cancer and various respiratory ailments. The World Health Organization says diseases linked to smoking kill at least 2,500,000 people each year. Research conducted in many countries also indicates that pregnant women who smoke run the risk of having deformed babies. Besides, it has been proven beyond doubt that when a person smokes, he subjects the people around him not only to great discomfort but also to physical harm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Secondly, smoking is extravagant. Smokers, either wage-earners or those who live off their parents, spend a large sum of money on cigarettes, which cost them at least 10% of their expenses each month. What's more, sensible women try to avoid marrying heavy smokers, even though some of them appreciate the image of a handsome young man with a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. A friend of mine, a heavy smoker, has been seeking an ideal wife who will tolerate his extravagant "hobby", but up to now he hasn't found one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Thirdly, smoking has a bad impact on the <T TYPE=HOT>psyche</T> of the smokers. After realizing the bad effects of smoking, many people try to give up smoking. But no matter how hard they try, some of them just can't resist the temptation to smoke again. Gradually, they lose confidence in themselves and get used to making excuses.<BR>
