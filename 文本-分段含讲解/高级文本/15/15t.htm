<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Alice Trillin was 38 and thought she was in excellent health.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then "this completely crazy thing" happened.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I coughed and a tiny, tiny blood clot took me to get a chest X-ray.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ten days later I had my lung removed."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Trillin had lung cancer, the kind smokers get.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But she had never smoked a cigarette.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The cause of her cancer remained a mystery until a doctor friend asked if her parents had smoked.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They had.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Nobody had ever said anything about passive smoking.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I hadn't worried about the question much," she says.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Most scientists hadn't worried about it much either, until studies in recent years showed that passive smoking was causing 3000 to 5000 lung cancer deaths a year among American non-smokers.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now a study estimates that the toll from passive smoking, including deaths from heart disease and other cancers, may be 10 times that.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Tobacco smoke in the home and workplace could be killing 46000 non-smokers each year in the United States, the study concludes.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> That's 3000 lung cancer deaths, 11000 from other cancers and 32000 heart disease deaths.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> That would make passive smoking the leading preventable cause of death in the United States after alcohol and smoking itself,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> said Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the US Office on Smoking and Health.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Smoking kills 390000; alcohol, 120000.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "No longer are we talking about runny nose or watery eyes or headache or nausea, but a fatal disease," Davis said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Passive smoking has become the principal battleground for the tobacco industry and its opponents in the 1980s.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is no longer merely a health issue, but political and environmental.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Cigarette pollution is fouling the air.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "We know that the indoor environment is far more polluted than the outdoor environment," said James Repace of the Environmental Protection Agency indoor air programme.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We've seen that again and again wherever we've looked all over the United States."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many people believe smokers have the right to smoke.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But they also believe that others shouldn't have to pay a price.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "When you talk about an involuntary risk, the society becomes much more cautious,"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> said University of California-San Francisco biomedical engineer Stanton Glantz, an environmentalist and anti-smoking activist.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The new estimate of non-smoker deaths is controversial.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Researchers agree it is preliminary and needs to be confirmed.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A tobacco industry consultant said the emphasis on passive smoking was misplaced.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many public health officials disagree.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The risk of tobacco smoke "is greater than the risk of radon gas is to non-smokers", Repace said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "We're talking maybe 40 per cent greater.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And if you're talking about all the carcinogenic air pollutants that EPA regulates, it's 100 times greater."</T>
