&nbsp; &nbsp;     Everyone knows how important money is in the world today. But what did Qi Gong do with his hard-earned one and a half million <I>yuan?</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mr. Qi Gong, aged 79, is a well-known calligrapher in China. He became famous the hard way. Born in a poor family, he did not have much schooling until his talent attracted the attention of Professor Chen Yuan, the president of Furen University. For years Professor Chen took him under his personal care and taught him literature and calligraphy. Professor Chen thought highly of Qi Gong and helped him to find jobs of teaching at several institutions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Years of hard work made Qi Gong an excellent teacher and outstanding calligrapher and painter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In memory of his teacher Professor Chen Yuan, Qi Gong decided in 1991 to set up a foundation to give awards to both teachers and students who excel in their work. Qi Gong worked day after day at his desk and produced more than 100 works of calligraphy, which he sold for 1,630,000 <I>yuan.</I> All this money went into the foundation which was named after his teacher. He did not leave a penny for himself!<BR>
