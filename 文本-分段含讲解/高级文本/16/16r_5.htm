<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Decent Beggars in Shanghai</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It was getting dark when the plane landed at Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai. A woman stepped out into a driving rain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Madam, you must be from Beijing," a voice behind her said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Taking luggage from the woman's hand, the man said, "The weather in the south is unpleasant, and it rains all the time. The rainy season is coming." He accompanied her out of the airport.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The woman thought she was lucky to meet such a warm-hearted young man. At the bus stop, she thanked him. "It's very kind of you. I would be <T TYPE=HOT>drenched</T> through without your help." She said quite a lot to express her gratitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     However, to her surprise, the man stood there smiling and showing no intention of leaving. Glancing around, the woman noticed some passengers getting off the same plane with her were tipping the people who helped them. She got the hint, took out a five-yuan note and gave it to the man. Saying "Thanks a lot", he went away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The young man is just one of the estimated 500 "decent beggars", a name Shanghai residents have given these people. Often times, they will appear in groups in the railway station, airport, hospitals, scenic spots. Most of them are fashionably dressed, behave decently, and speak in a gentle way. They carefully observe their "customers", and from their expression, they try to figure out what their "customers" are thinking about. They will show sympathy for a patient sent to the hospital, with tears in their eyes. They will flatter the "customer" until he or she is deeply moved and gives them money in gratitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     On May 1, a family went to a park. Just as they entered, a young couple with smiles on their faces came up. The man talked first.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Look! What a pleasant day! It is very nice for the whole family to spend the holiday in the park," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The woman added, "We Shanghai people are often kept indoors by the rain. It is too bad for children in particular. On this fine day, it is quite good for your health to walk in the open."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Then they began to flatter the children, saying they were so beautiful and would be promising in the future. They predicated that the parents would enjoy a very happy life with wealthy and devoted sons and daughters. They did not stop talking until the mother gave them a 10-yuan note. The mother did not feel sorry for giving the money. She said that she had bought good fortune with the money. Some people say it is this psychology that the "decent beggars" cater to in making money. <BR>
