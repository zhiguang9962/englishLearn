&nbsp; &nbsp;    "You must be mad," his friends said, as thirty-year-old John Briggs of Hatfield left London Airport to fly to Brazil. John was going half-way round the world to meet a girl he'd never seen but hoped to marry. The trip was costing him three months' pay ！ in fact he'd had to borrow from his father and an aunt to buy his ticket ！ and he had no idea whether the pretty dark-haired girl he only knew from photographs and letters would even like him. "I'd had a good life as a bachelor," says John, four years later, his arm round his wife and their two lovely children, "but I felt something was missing. I had a good job, my own house and plenty of friends. I'd had plenty of girlfriends too, but somehow no one ever seemed quite the right girl for me. Then one day I was looking through a magazine during my lunch hour when a photograph of a pretty girl caught my eye. It was part of an advertisement for a World Penfriends Circle. I decided to write off to them immediately. All my friends had a good laugh, I remember."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    John received the names of four girls, two from Japan, one from Finland, and one from Brazil, and wrote to all of them, enclosing a photograph of himself. The last to reply was Maria from Brazil, but it was Maria who came to take first place in John's heart. They wrote to each other for a year, Maria in <T TYPE=HOT>Portuguese</T> and John in English ！ all the letters had to be translated ！ and then one of Maria's uncles came to England on a business trip. Maria had asked him to arrange a meeting with John and report back to Brazil on what her English penfriend was really like. The uncle said that John was "a fat little fellow without much hair", but he must have said some nicer things too, for Maria's parents wrote to John inviting him to visit their family. John replied saying he'd love to.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    A practical man, John started to get organized. As soon as he had the money for his air ticket he wrote to Maria asking her what her views on getting married were. He also sent an engagement ring, and a Valentine card every day! Maria wrote back to say they could decide whether to get married or not once they met ！ but she started making a wedding dress of beautiful white silk, just in case ...<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    The day John was due to arrive Maria waited anxiously at the airport. Suppose he didn't like her? But when his plane came in she didn't even recognize him! Her uncle had to point him out. "He was the man with the nicest smile," says Maria, "and he was just the right height for me!" They both realized immediately that they were just right for each other in lots of other ways too. Ten days later they were married and Maria came to live in England with her husband ！ "the best thing that's ever come to me through the post" she says.<BR>
