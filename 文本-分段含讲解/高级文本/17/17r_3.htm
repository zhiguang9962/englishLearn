<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Husband and Wife for ¡ê45 Each</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Attractive Kay Knight is expecting her first baby in a few months' time. She smiled happily at her husband Mike as she told us their story. "I woke up on my thirty-fifth birthday thinking,¡®Help. I'm turning into a real old spinster schoolteacher.' All my friends seemed to be married with homes and families of their own. But where was I? I love my job ¡ª don't get me wrong. I've had a very satisfying career, but teaching other people's children isn't the same as bringing up your own." "She'll make a wonderful mother," said Mike. "I can't think why she wasn't <T TYPE=HOT>snapped up</T> years ago. But I'm glad she wasn't, or I wouldn't have found her."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  How did they find each other? "Well," said Kay, "as a young woman I'd had a few boyfriends, but never anything serious. Then I realized I wasn't even meeting any men, not unmarried ones anyway. So I took a deep breath and wrote to a Marriage Bureau." Kay had to fill in a detailed form and then attend an interview. "It was very thorough," she said. "They really wanted to make sure I was serious about wanting to get married, and they took a lot of trouble to find out what kind of person I was and the sort of man I thought I'd like to marry. I was told I'd be given three introductions to suitable men for a fee of ¡ê15. If I married one of them, I'd have to pay another ¡ê30. The first introduction was to another teacher, which she didn't think was a good idea, but the second was to Mike.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mike took up the story. "I got married when I was a young man of 22, but my wife was killed a year later in a car accident. I was completely shattered. I put all my energies into my work and spent many years abroad with my firm. Then I came back to England to work at Head Office and realized how empty my life had become. I didn't just want to work; I wanted a wife and children. I needed someone to make my house into a home. I wasn't interested in young girls, but how could I find a mature, loving woman to share my life? I think my sister and brother-in-law must have guessed how I was feeling. They introduced me to a charming older couple one evening. After they'd gone home I remarked how well-suited they seemed and my sister told me why ¡ª they'd met through a Marriage Bureau.¡®You should give it a try,' she said. So I did."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mike phoned a bureau the very next day and went for an interview the following week. He was given three names, including Kay's. He wrote to her first because he thought a school-teacher would probably like children. Their first date was a disaster. "We agreed to meet for a picnic and it poured with rain," he told us. "But we both saw the funny side of it, and from then on everything went right." Within a month of their first meeting he proposed and they got engaged. The wedding took place a year ago. "Speaking as a businessman," said Mike, "this is the best deal I've ever made!"<br>
