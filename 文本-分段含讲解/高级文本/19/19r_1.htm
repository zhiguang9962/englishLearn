<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Tokyo </B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     I don't live in Tokyo. I don't even know whether I would like to live there. I love it and hate it ！ it is one of those places that you can love and hate at the same time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The first "fact" about Tokyo, for me, is that there are too many people. I don't mean the fact that more than twelve million people live there. A number like 12,000,000 doesn't mean anything to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Tokyo there are always too many people in the places where I want to be. That is the important fact for me. Of course there are too many cars. The Japanese drive very fast when they can, but in Tokyo they often spend a long time in traffic jams. Tokyo is not different from London, Paris and New York in that. It is different when one wants to walk. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     At certain times of the day there are a lot of people on foot in London's Oxford Street or near the big shops and stores in other great cities. But the streets near the Ginza in Tokyo always have a lot of people on foot, and sometimes it is really difficult to walk. People are very polite; there are just too many of them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The worst time to be in the street is at 11:30 at night. That is when the night-clubs are closing and everybody wants to go home. There are 35,000 night-clubs in Tokyo, and you do not often see one that is empty. Between 11 and 12 everybody is looking for a taxi. Usually the taxis are shared by four or five people who live in the same part of the city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     During the day, people use the trains. Perhaps the first thing you notice in Tokyo is the number of trains. Most people travel to and from work by train, and there is a station at almost every street corner. Tokyo people buy six million train tickets every day. One station ！ Shinjuku ！ has two million passengers each day. At most stations, trains arrive every two or three minutes, but at certain hours there do not seem to be enough trains. At 8 o'clock in the morning you can see students pushing passengers into the trains. Usually the trains are nearly full when they arrive at the station, so the students have to push very hard. Sometimes the pushers are also pushed in by mistake, and they have to get out at the next station. Some people who are pushed into the train lose their shoes. They, too, get out at the next station, and go back to look for them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Although they are usually crowded, Japanese trains are very good. They always leave and arrive on time. On a London train you would see everybody reading a newspaper. In Tokyo trains everybody <I>in a seat</I> seems to be asleep. Some Japanese make a train journey of two hours to go to work, so they do their sleeping on the train. But if a train journey lasts only five minutes, and if they have a seat, they will also go to sleep. They always wake when they arrive at their station.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The last time I went to Tokyo, I went there from Osaka in great comfort. The blue-and-white trains which run every half-hour between the two cities are not only very fast but very comfortable. There are no pushers; only those who have reserved seats can travel on the train. It was not possible to run more trains on the old lines, so the Japanese built a special line for the new fast trains. It is a very good line indeed. You can eat and drink without difficulty at 220 kilometres an hour ！ you know the speed because there is a speedometer inside the carriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Tokyo, I stood outside the station for five minutes. Three fire-engines ！ the very latest kind with every modern fitting ！ raced past on the way to one of the many fires that Tokyo has every day. The people who passed on foot included some of the loveliest girls in the world in the latest European dresses or the finest Japanese <T TYPE=HOT>kimonos</T>. Businessmen passed in big new cars, and among them, in a small Honda, there was a <T TYPE=HOT>geisha</T> in the clothes and hair arrangement of hundreds of years ago. Tokyo has so many surprises that none of them can really surprise me now. Instead, I am surprised at myself: I must go there next week on business, and I know that I shall hate the city and its twelve million people. But I feel like a man who is returning to his long-lost love.<BR>
