<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Duo Duo Bar, Where Many Meet</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A small coffee shop on Xidan Street, barely wider than a hallway, has become a <T TYPE=HOT>haunt</T> for many young people in downtown Beijing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The Duo Duo Coffee Bar has a charm of its own. Its red walls adorned with <T TYPE=HOT>reed</T> and bamboo hats and a spider web hanging from its dark ceiling remind one of the sunsets, perhaps at lakeside in a light drizzle. This is the atmosphere in which people sip a cup of coffee, tea or wine while chatting with their friends.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Duo Duo (Chinese for many) is owned by two young men, Zhang Keyu, a technician, and Lu Wei, an artist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "We started this coffee bar not only for making money," said Zhang, 27, in a soft voice. "We want to offer our young friends a place for social contact. If what we earn is enough for paying the tax, we are satisfied.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Before opening this bar, we often held weekend parties at home in which we chatted, sang and danced. Then an idea occurred to us to open a coffee shop so that we could know more people and more about the society.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Without wasting any time, Lu Wei and I took out all our savings to refurnish this room. Our friends did what they could to help us. Lu Wei did the decoration himself, using a lot of reed, which is what his name means. Within a month, this mini-coffee room opened its door to the public."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The atmosphere appealed mostly to young people. A university graduate, for instance, needed a place to hold a farewell party. The young owners offered the bar to him free of charge and suspended their business for the night. The young man invited 20 friends. And the party was a great success.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Making friends is more important than making money," Zhang observed. Being a full-time technician, Zhang has to work in his company by day and work in his coffee bar by night. He hires no employees. His friends volunteer to serve in this shop.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A fashion designer whose nickname is also Duo Duo came in one day. "I'm glad my name is the same as this lovely bar's. I wish I had as many friends as it has," she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Pierre was a French student on a study tour in Beijing. He enjoyed himself in the bar so much that he could not help dancing like Charlie Chaplain and blowing on the <T TYPE=HOT>suona</T>, a Chinese wind instrument.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Business has been good since the bar opened last year, but there were minor troubles when two or three <T TYPE=HOT>rascals</T> said they could not pay for their drinks. All we could do was ask them to write down their names on our credit list. Sometimes a rude fellow would drop in and talk too loudly. But the quiet atmosphere here would soon make him feel out of place and he would leave. I wish I could write a novel about society based on what I've seen and heard in this bar," Zhang said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It was already midnight. Xidan Street was asleep and empty. But the lights in Duo Duo still beckoned lonely walkers. Inside the room, customers were still chatting or humming.<BR>
