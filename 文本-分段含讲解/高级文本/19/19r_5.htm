<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Problem for Beijingers</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Improving public toilets has long been a serious problem in Beijing, as well as the rest of China.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There is a <T TYPE=HOT>wry</T> saying among Chinese people, "Follow the smell if you want to find a toilet."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "About 80 per cent of Beijing's public toilets fit the saying," admitted Xue Baoyi, an official from Beijing Sanitation Bureau in 1989.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But at the western gate of the Chinese History Museum near Tian'anmen Square, there is an unusual "luxury" toilet of about 300 square metres, in which there are rockeries, <T TYPE=HOT>fountains</T>, fresh flowers, a sofa and piped music. The standard of cleanliness is extremely high.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But visitors have to pay 0.3 <I>yuan.</I> Some say the clean toilet is worth the price, but others complain that they can not afford it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Beijing there are now 40 such toilets at tourist sites.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     On the opposite side of the museum, by the southern gate of Zhongshan Park, is situated another fairly clean pay toilet. Since last March, Liu Zhaomin, a retired sanitation worker from the West City District Cleaning Team, and his wife have contracted to keep the facility clean, and the once dirty and foul-smelling toilet has become one of the cleanest in Beijing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The old couple charge 0.03 <I>yuan</I> per person, but disabled people and students are admitted free. Outside the toilet they also provide water and help people take care of their belongings - all for free.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Their service not only earns the old couple about 800 <I>yuan</I> monthly, but it also saves the government money. The toilet fees pay for maintenance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There are no public toilets in some areas of the city. About 200 WCs in downtown area have to have soil carried away manually, mostly by old workers who are near retirement, and it is now very difficult to recruit young people to do this job. Because of a shortage of manpower, tools and <T TYPE=HOT>disinfectant</T>, it's very hard to keep those public toilets clean.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "WC service in Beijing has four key problems," said Xue. "There are no places and money for building public toilets. And most of them are in a very poor condition, and are badly managed."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Xue also said that the users should take care of public toilets. Many newly-painted walls in WCs are already dirty.<BR>
