&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Avoid the rush-hour" must be the slogan of large cities the world over.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If it is, it's a slogan no one takes the least notice of.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Twice a day, with predictable regularity, the pot boils over.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Wherever you look it's people, people, people.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The trains which leave or arrive every few minutes are packed: an endless procession of human sardine tins.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The streets are so crowded, there is hardly room to move on the pavements.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The queues for buses reach staggering proportions.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It takes ages for a bus to get to you because the traffic on the roads has virtually come to a standstill.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even when a bus does at last arrive, it's so full, it can't take any more passengers.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This whole crazy system of commuting stretches man's resources to the utmost.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The smallest unforeseen event can bring about conditions of utter chaos.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A power-cut, for instance, an exceptionally heavy snowfall or a minor derailment must always make city-dwellers realize how precarious the balance is.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The extraordinary thing is not that people put up with these conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Large modern cities are too big to control.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They impose their own living conditions on the people who inhabit them.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> City-dwellers are obliged by their environment to adopt a wholly unnatural way of life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They lose touch with the land and rhythm of nature.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is possible to live such an airconditioned existence in a large city that you are barely conscious of the seasons.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A few flowers in a public park (if you have the time to visit it) may remind you that it is spring or summer.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A few leaves clinging to the pavement may remind you that it is autumn.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Beyond that, what is going on in nature seems totally irrelevant.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All the simple, good things of life like sunshine and fresh air are at a premium.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Tall buildings blot out the sun.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Traffic fumes pollute the atmosphere.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even the distinction between day and night is lost.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The flow of traffic goes on unceasingly and the noise never stops.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly for the "privilege" of living in a city.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The demand for accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people to buy a house of their own.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Exorbitant rents must be paid for tiny flats which even country hens would disdain to live in.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Accommodation apart, the cost of living is very high.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just about everything you buy is likely to be more expensive than it would be in the country.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In addition to all this, city-dwellers live under constant threat.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The crime rate in most cities is very high.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Houses are burgled with alarming frequency.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Cities breed crime and violence and are full of places you would be afraid to visit at night.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If you think about it, they are not really fit to live in at all.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Can anyone really doubt that the country is what man was born for and where he truly belongs?</T>
