<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Mother Pays More Attention to Pet Dog Than to Her Young Boy</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Dear Ann Landers: I hope you will publish your answer to this letter because there is a family out there that needs help - fast!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     My friend (I'll call her Krista) married a nice guy in 1978. He's a sales <T TYPE=HOT>rep</T> on the road most of the time. Krista and Cal had a son five years ago. A nice family unit. About a month after Junior was born, Cal gave Krista a purebred <T TYPE=HOT>beagle</T>. She went crazy about the dog and treated him better than the baby.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When Junior was old enough to crawl, he began to pull the dog's tail and hit him when he thought nobody was looking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Two months ago, Junior began <T TYPE=HOT>urinating</T> in unexpected and inappropriate places. First, into his mother's shoe, then in her purse, next her jewel box. After he was punished for ruining the jewel box, he found some scissors and cut his mother's string of pearls.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     At first Krista attributed the urinating to Junior's laziness. I told her if it were laziness, he would just wet his <T TYPE=HOT>pants</T> and not seek special places.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Last Christmas Day, it snowed heavily. I called Krista to chat. She sounded breathless. I asked her what she had been doing. "I've been playing outside in the snow with the dog," was her reply. I asked where Junior was. She replied, "Upstairs, watching television, I guess." What do you see here, Ann? Sign me - A Worried Friend.<BR>
