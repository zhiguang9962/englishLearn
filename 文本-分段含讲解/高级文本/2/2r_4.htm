&nbsp; &nbsp;     In ancient Egypt, people believed that the cat was a god. When a cat died its owners showed their sadness by the strange habit of shaving their eyebrows off! More recently, in the last century in fact, the famous English writer Charles Dickens had a cat who was very fond of him. The cat didn't like to see Dickens working too hard. At night, when the cat wanted to say "Stop writing!" to his master, he often put out Dickens' candle with his paw!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When animals become pets, the result, after a number of generations, is a smaller animal with a smaller brain. Rabbits, for example, which live as pets in a garden, are much less intelligent than their wild cousins. Of course, man doesn't always keep animals for pleasure. Many animals have to work for their masters.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There was once a farm in Namibia, Africa, which had 80 goats. Instead of a <T TYPE=HOT>goatherd</T>, there was a female <T TYPE=HOT>baboon</T>. She took her goats to the hills every day and brought them back at night. She always knew exactly which goats were hers - which is more than many humans could do!<BR>
