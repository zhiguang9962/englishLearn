<P ALIGN=center><B>7. Too Many Pets in France</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In France a campaign has been launched to warn against the danger of a threatening over-population ... of pets! The country is the second most densely populated country in the world as far as domestic animals are concerned. At the moment it is inhabited by more than 8.5 million dogs and almost as many cats. Every second family in Paris owns one or more pets, which cause problems of hygiene that cannot be solved. In the year 2000 France will have more than 15 million dogs if no drastic measures are taken to stop this increase. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The French organization for the protection of animals has appealed to the owners to have their dogs and cats of both sexes <T TYPE=HOT>sterilized</T>, because the animals themselves are in danger of becoming the first victims. Every summer, when the <T TYPE=HOT>holiday-exodus</T> begins, thousands of dogs and cats are abandoned, because their owners, unable to take them along, do not want to or cannot find homes where their pets will be looked after during their absence. Only one of three of these stray animals can be adopted, the other two must be killed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A great number of pet-owners, however, object to sterilization on grounds of "inadmissible cruelty".<BR>
