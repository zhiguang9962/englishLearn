&nbsp; &nbsp;     "My mouth watered as I imagined the lovely soup I could make from some bones in the butcher's window. There was a lot of meat on them, too. So I went in and bought some.¡®Certainly, one pound of bones for your dog, madam,' said the butcher brightly. My next stop was at the fish shop, where I asked for some cheap fish.¡®For your cat?' asked the assistant. As you may have guessed, neither bones nor fish were for pets ¡ª they were for me, a pensioner. But it made me think that many animals eat better meals than people!"<BR>
