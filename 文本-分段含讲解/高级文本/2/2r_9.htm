&nbsp; &nbsp;     "We have a friend who works in a Dog <T TYPE=HOT>Parlour</T> where they sell coats for dogs. A customer, choosing a coat, tried to describe her dog and the saleswoman suggested she bring the dog in so that they could fit him. Horrified, the customer replied that she couldn't do that as it was for the dog's birthday present and she didn't want him to see it!"<BR>
