&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The basic meaning of "pet" is an animal we keep for emotional rather than economic reasons.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A pet animal is kept as a companion, and we all need companions to keep us feeling happy.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But pets offer us more than mere companionship; they invite us to love and be loved.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many owners feel their pets understand them, for animals are quick to sense anger and sorrow.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Often a cat or dog can comfort us at times when human words don't help.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We feel loved, too, by the way pets depend on us for a home, for food and drink.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Dogs especially, look up to their owners, which makes them feel important and needed.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A pet can be something different to each member of the family, another baby to the mother, a sister or brother to an only child, a grandchild to the elderly,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but for all of us pets provide pleasure and companionship.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It has even been suggested that tiny pets should be sent as companions to astronauts on space ships, to help reduce the stress and loneliness of space flights.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In this Plastic Age, when most of us live in large cities, pets are particularly important for children.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A pet in the family keeps people in touch with the more natural, animal world.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Seeing an animal give birth brings understanding of the naturalness of childbirth, and seeing a pet die helps a child to cope with sorrow.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Learning to care for a pet helps a child to grow up into a loving adult who feels responsible towards those dependent on him.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Rightly we teach children to be good to their pets.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They should learn, too, that pets are good for us human beings.</T>
