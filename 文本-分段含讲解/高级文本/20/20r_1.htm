<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Encouraging Atmosphere for Housing Reform</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The current atmosphere in respect of reform in housing is still encouraging, the experts and economists said. Despite some areas and departments having resorted to the attitude of "wait-and-see" and even called a halt to housing reform, attributable to the April-June social unrest, 26 out of the country's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions are still maintaining their endeavours <T TYPE=HOT>adhering to</T> the scheduled restructure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Out in the main metropolises, Beijing and Tianjin are experimenting with a reform <T TYPE=HOT>scenario</T> of "multiple directions", such as raising rents for public residential housing, encouraging urban residents to buy more State-built housing, arranging funds to build commercial high-rises, setting up housing deposit banks and the like.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Shanghai, the largest city in China, is also drafting its blueprint to quicken the pace of its housing reform in keeping up with their housing requirements.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, an overall housing reform plan is beginning this month. The municipal government plan stipulates that all residents living in non-privately-owned houses, including those owned by the city's real estate administration departments and by State and collective units, will have to purchase their dwellings or rent them at a rate set by the government.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The housing reform characterized by selling of housing and raising rents will be enormously conducive to the healthy development of China's economy in all sectors, some economists maintain.<BR>
