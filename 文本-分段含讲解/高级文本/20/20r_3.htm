<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Tianjin Folks Can Buy Their Own Houses</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A double blessing descended upon Wang Jianpo, a worker at the Tianjin Machine Tool Plant, last month.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     He married a beautiful young girl and bought a two-room flat - a thing considered by many Chinese young men even harder than finding a wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     At the wedding ceremony, which took place in the new flat recently, Wang and his wife presented some wedding candies to the city leaders to express their gratitude for the government's efforts to build more housing for sale for local residents.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The young couple is one of the 20,000 households who moved into new houses built at their own expense last month.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The State covered the expenses for infrastructures such as roads linking all the apartment blocks, waterworks and sewers. Nearby industrial enterprises financed construction of grain shops, groceries and parks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Construction costs were shared by the local government, would-be buyers and most local enterprises.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "The method is a good way to speed up urban housing construction and tallies with the current consumption level of Chinese urbanites," said a local government official.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There is no doubt that money collected from house sales will greatly relieve the shortage of funds for new construction, the official added.<BR>
