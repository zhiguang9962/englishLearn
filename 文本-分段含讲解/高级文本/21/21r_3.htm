<P ALIGN=center><B>3. You Can Get Promoted Half a Grade if You Are Willing to Say:</B></P><BR>
<P ALIGN=center><B>"Yes Sir, No Sir!"</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     An unhappy victim of the consumer society is Mr. Batia, a fifty-two-year-old Indian journalist working in broadcasting. For him, however, the misery is caused less by the nature of his work than by the competitive atmosphere which surrounds it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Mr. Batia: "I'm not interested in my job. I'm not being treated properly and there are many injustices. I just do honest work, but I do as little as I can. The atmosphere is very polluted. You can get promoted half a grade if you're willing to say:¡®Yes sir, no sir!' I've been there twenty-three years, and I hate the whole mentality of the place. They treat me like a colonial. They think I live in the colonies, but I've done things in journalism that have never been done before. I have a colleague who is half a grade up and when the boss is away he's supposed to <T TYPE=HOT>officiate</T>. I've had <T TYPE=HOT>rows</T> with him; I have a hot temper. I said to him:¡®Lood, don't you try to boss me or one of us will end up on the floor. I've met good Englishmen and bad Englishmen, and you're the worst Englishman I've ever met.'"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I'm honest and outspoken and people don't like me. Nobody likes me. If you are a <T TYPE=HOT>crook</T> you can get on well."<BR>
