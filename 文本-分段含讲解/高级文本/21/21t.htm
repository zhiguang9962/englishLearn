<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In the world of work, flattery will get you everywhere.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Employees who flatter their bosses tend to receive better evaluations and move more easily up the corporate ladder ！ whether they deserve to or not ！</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> said Gerald Ferris, management professor at Texas A and M University.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Based on what we have found, it looks to be the case that political skills are highly reinforced out there in the work place.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is the politically astute that are more often promoted," Ferris said in an interview.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> His conclusions are based on surveys of employees and supervisors taken as part of his research into political behaviour in the office.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "People tend to believe that flattery is just too transparent to be effective, but we have found that is not necessarily true.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We have found a strong correlation between this type of behaviour and good evaluations," Ferris said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The reasons that flattery works are many, Ferris said, but most apparently have to do either with the boss's ego, or insecurity, or both.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some supervisors enjoy having their egos boosted by complimentary employees, while others simply need the reinforcement of consent, he said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "What we have found is that often bosses are new or unsure of themselves and need a lot of social reinforcement for their decisions.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They might look at flattery as a sign that they are right," Ferris said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The reasons employees flatter bosses vary, too, Ferris said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Ambition ！ the desire to move up the corporate ladder ！ is often behind the compliments, he said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Also, many workers use flattery to obscure their laziness or incompetence.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "We did find a big gap between some of the people doing this manipulation and those that did not.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many of these people (flattering the boss) were not the high performers.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They were doing it to cover up their shortcomings," he said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But if flatterers are not always top workers, they frequently are what social scientists call "high self-monitors", Ferris said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Those are people who are highly attuned to and aware of their surroundings and know what to do to get a favourable response," he said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Fellow employees are not blind to what their colleagues are doing, Ferris said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But, while they may disapprove, they usually do not tell the boss for fear of appearing jealous, he said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Flattery works best when the employee is saying something he or she really means, Ferris said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But sincere or not, it should be done in moderation.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "If you overdo it or if you are not sincere and the boss catches on, it can mean trouble," he said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You have to be subtle and not take it too far."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One way employees can avoid appearing too flattering is to occasionally disagree with the boss on minor points, he said.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In that way, the employee avoids being viewed as a "yes-man".</T>
