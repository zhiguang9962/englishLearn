<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Police Are Pals to Convicts</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It doesn't look like a jail at first sight. Situated in Jixi County in remote northeastern Jilin Province, this prison has neither high walls nor <T TYPE=HOT>electrified barbed wire</T> to prevent prisoners from escaping.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A small wooden fence around the compound looks like those around farmers' fields. Only the word "Cordon" printed on the planks suggest something unusual about the place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Since 1986 none of the several hundred male prisoners jailed here has tried to escape. And those who have finished their sentences seldom return to crime. The <T TYPE=HOT>recidivism</T> rate in only 0.5 per cent, much lower than the 3 per cent common in other Chinese prisons.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Perhaps even more amazing is 80 per cent of the released inmates have become friends of their guards.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Some ex-convicts have travelled many miles back to the prison to see Wang Hongwu, the head of the security police.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     One sent a bull of fine breed when he heard that a bull was badly needed in the prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It was quite a different story when the prison was first set up years ago. The prisoners toed the line during the day but were <T TYPE=HOT>hellions</T> at night, stealing chickens from the farmers' cottages and causing all sorts of mischief. These acts precipitated many letters of complaint to the authorities from residents who had become victims.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Then Wang stepped in. That was in 1984.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     To the prisoners' surprise, the 40-year-old security veteran used talk rather than punishment to restore discipline.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wang finally got to know most of the prisoners and their concerns. Many were afraid that their spouses would divorce them and their children would be left homeless. Many worried about their work and life after being released.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wang set out policies to reform his prisoners. He developed education programmes tailor-made to each prisoner's specific case and family background. The prisoners were moved by his sincerity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A <T TYPE=HOT>larcener</T> was frightened when his wife asked for a divorce the first time she came to see him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "This is the last time we see each other," the wife said. "I sent the divorce papers to the court yesterday. I will return with our son to my hometown in Shandong Province tomorrow."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Angry and disappointed, the larcener pretended to be indifferent and said he agreed and that it didn't matter to him what she did.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I will find a better girl if I'm released," he told his sobbing wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When she left he burst into tears. Wang came to his cell and asked why he cried since he had agreed to the divorce. The larcener confessed he could not live without his wife; he simply did not want to lose face before the other prisoners.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Later on, Wang got to know that the couple loved each other deeply. The wife wanted a divorce because she felt embarrassed when she met his friends and was looked down upon by her mother-in-law since he was put in jail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wang believed the man's reform would be harder to achieve if some solution to this dilemma wasn't found. He wrote to the larcener's brother-in-law, his wife's brother who was a middle-school teacher in Shandong Province, urging him to persuade his sister to change her mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ten days later, Wang received a letter from Wang's brother-in-law, saying that he would try to persuade his sister into taking back the divorce papers and waiting for her husband.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Half a month later, the wife came with her son to the prison to see her husband and express her gratitude to Wang Hongwu.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The larcener pledged to reform and Wang said he would try to get him as early a release as possible.<BR>
