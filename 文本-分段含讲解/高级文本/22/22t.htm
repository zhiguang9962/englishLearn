<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Perhaps all criminals should be required to carry cards which read: Fragile: Handle with Care.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It will never do, these days, to go around referring to criminals as violent thugs.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> You must refer to them politely as "social misfits".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The professional killer who wouldn't think twice about using his cosh or crowbar to batter some harmless old lady to death in order to rob her of her meagre life-savings must never be given a dose of his own medicine.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is in need of "hospital treatment".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> According to his misguided defenders, society is to blame.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A wicked society breeds evil ¡ª or so the argument goes.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you listen to this kind of talk, it makes you wonder why we aren't all criminals.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We have done away with the absurdly harsh laws of the nineteenth century and this is only right.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But surely enough is enough.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The most senseless piece of criminal legislation in Britain and a number of other countries has been the suspension of capital punishment.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The violent criminal has become a kind of hero-figure in our time.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is glorified on the screen; he is pursued by the press and paid vast sums of money for his "memoirs".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Newspapers which specialise in crime-reporting enjoy enormous circulations and the publishers of trashy cops and robbers stories or "murder mysteries" have never had it so good.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When you read about the achievements of the great train robbers, it makes you wonder whether you are reading about some glorious resistance movement.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The hardened criminal is cuddled and cosseted by the sociologists on the one hand and adored as a hero by the masses on the other.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's no wonder he is a privileged person who expects and receives VIP treatment wherever he goes.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Capital punishment used to be a major deterrent.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It made the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It gave the cold-blooded poisoner something to ponder about while he was shaking up or serving his arsenic cocktail.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It prevented unarmed policemen from being mowed down while pursuing their duty by killers armed with automatic weapons.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Above all, it protected the most vulnerable members of society, young children, from brutal sex-maniacs.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is horrifying to think that the criminal can literally get away with murder.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We all know that "life sentence" does not mean what it says.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> After ten years or so of "good conduct" the most desperate villain is free to return to society where he will live very comfortably, thank you,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> on the proceeds of his crime, or he will go on committing offences until he is caught again.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People are always willing to hold liberal views at the expense of others.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's always fashionable to pose as the defender of the under-dog, so long as you, personally, remain unaffected.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Did the defenders of crime, one wonders, in their desire for fair-play, consult the victims before they suspended capital punishment? </T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Hardly. You see, they couldn't, because all the victims were dead.</T>
