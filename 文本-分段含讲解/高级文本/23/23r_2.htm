<P ALIGN=center><B>2. How It Feels to Be Out of Job</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Xu Peihua, 26, was fired from her job at the Shanghai No 5 Silk Knitting Factory in January 1987 after she became ill.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The community committee where Xu lived was supposed to compensate her for 70 per cent of her medical expenses for one year after she left the factory. But after a year, her illness got worse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A Shanghai hospital refused to take her in unless she paid a deposit of 10,000 <I>yuan.</I> After much negotiation with the hospital, she was taken in, after paying 5,000 <I>yuan</I> deposit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Her problems were not over. Her unemployment insurance <T TYPE=HOT>expired</T> and so she no longer received her 40-yuan monthly pension. She had nowhere to go to get compensation for her hospital fees. Xu needed money urgently, but no institutions would help.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Xu's former employer, the Shanghai No. 5 Silk Knitting Factory, said that their responsibility for her ended once she was fired. So they refused to give a penny.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The Shanghai Labour Service Company, which has an unemployment pension fund of 20 million <I>yuan</I> at its disposal, could not help with the medical bills because Xu was no longer eligible for a pension.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Neither could she receive assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs. Their welfare coverage extends to divorced people, single seniors, homeless youngsters, relatives of <T TYPE=HOT>martyrs</T> and soldiers in service, and disabled people. Xu did not fall into any of these categories, so she did not qualify.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But not all jobless people share Xu's fate. A window may shut, but a door may open. A number of unemployed people have made a successful transition from "iron rice bowl" to working on their own or for private business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Li Chunying of the Shenyang Steel Pipes Factory was one of the few university graduates who lost her job. She had only worked there a year after she had graduated.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Before the reality of unemployment happened to her, she had only heard about such situations in countries like the United States or Japan where some university graduates, even a few with master's or doctor's degrees, could not find a job. In China, university graduates were highly sought by enterprises.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     For four months, Li rode around Shenyang on her bike job-hunting. She wrote three examinations given by potential employers and at last got a job at a research institute that urgently needed translators. It was a job she had long wanted and now was very happy to get.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As Li's case shows, losing a job doesn't necessarily mean bad luck. It may even bring a better, more satisfying job.<BR>
