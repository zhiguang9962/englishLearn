&nbsp; &nbsp;     It used to be quite an embarrassing thing in China for a person to be dismissed by his or her employer. But things are different now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Take Beijing as an example. Many people now seek the opportunity to be sacked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Last year, some 14,000 people succeeded in leaving their work places by resigning or having their employers dismiss them. Many of them were the backbone of their enterprises, including skilled workers and college graduates just assigned to their work places.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Enterprise leaders hold that many things account for the changing of jobs. Some people are not content with the situation in their work units; some are attracted by the higher income of self-employed workers and those who work for foreign interest-involved businesses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A woman used to work for a commerce college as a teacher in Beijing, but she found it more interesting to work for a corporation as an office worker.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     She said: "Satisfaction in my career is what I want."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Not all of those who left their work units find new jobs instantly. They become frequent visitors to the labour market in the capital. Some are lucky and are well received, but some are not, especially those who do not have special professional skills.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is not unusual for some people to try to return to their original work units because they fail to find suitable new jobs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Some who quit enjoy a new success in their career. A street pedlar said, "I just regret I left the factory too late ..." The pedlar wore a suit of Western-style clothes and apparently is well-off now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But another pedlar said that they earn money only through hardship. "We suffer coldness in winter and heat in summer, spending all day in open air." And he told a reporter that a pedlar who worked near him had returned to his original work unit because he found it too hard to be a self-employed worker.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The frequent change of jobs among employees represents a challenge to the years-old job allocation system in China, revealing the fact that people have begun to pay attention to their personal values and have a sense of competition. The flow of personnel in the form of quitting old jobs to find new ones cannot be stopped by mere administrative means. Such a flow is inevitable in the development of a commodity economy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The problem can only be solved by further reform.<BR>
