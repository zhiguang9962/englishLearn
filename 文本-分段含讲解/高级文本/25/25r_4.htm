<P ALIGN=center><B>4. Fake Advertising Seeks the Gullible</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Want to make gasoline and <T TYPE=HOT>diesel</T> fuel in your own home?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Want to have the capacity to drink a thousand shots of <T TYPE=HOT>booze</T> without being <T TYPE=HOT>tipsy</T>?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Want to add three centimetres a month to your height?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Sounds ridiculous? These impossible dreams have been offered to people in this country. And they are just a few examples of the false advertising that has become one of the major problems hounding a modernizing Chinese society.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Last year, the Chinese Consumers' Association alone received 55,871 complaints about the deceptive advertising, more than doubling the figure for 1987.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In spite of repeated crackdowns their numbers are still increasing each year, according to officials with the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Fake advertising, which appears mostly in print media, cheats consumers, and in some serious cases, threatens <T TYPE=HOT>gullible</T> people's lives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     As part of the latest campaign against <T TYPE=HOT>phoney</T> <T TYPE=HOT>hucksters</T> this year, the Beijing Administration of Industry and Commerce has just forbidden all publications to carry the column called "Tips on how to get rich. " Though many people have learned about a product or a technology through the column, much of the information in the column is provided by <T TYPE=HOT>swindlers</T>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     For instance, after a private school advertised that it was offering a course on how to make <T TYPE=HOT>fluorescent lamp</T> tubes at home, a farmer from Jilin Province came to Beijing to learn the skills.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     However, after spending 30,000 <I>yuan</I> of family savings, the farmer didn't produce a single tube. Realizing the whole thing was a <T TYPE=HOT>hoax</T>, the bankrupt farmer repeatedly attempted suicide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     According to SAIC officials, there are several reasons for the rampant fake advertising.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     First, some enterprises, especially township and private ones, use fake advertising to push sales of their substandard or fake products.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Sheng Xincheng, a private businessman in Xinjiang, advertised for his "fine cow-hide shoes." Customers outside Xinjiang sent him 180,000 <I>yuan</I> ($48,000) only to get back inferior plastic shoes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Second, many newspapers, magazines and other media take the advertising because they need the money and don't care about the ethics of the ad's contents.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Third, China does not have effective laws and regulations to prevent such advertising.<BR>
