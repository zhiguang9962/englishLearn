<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One night, when television began broadcasting a boring TV show, I said to my wife,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "The programme is even less interesting than the advertisements, or commercials. Let us have a change."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My wife, who happened to have a remote control in her hand, consented immediately, switched to another channel and enjoyed an advertisement of rice flour with me.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Just at the moment, I found that we were no longer as disgusted with the commercials as we had been before.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The next day when I told my experience to my colleagues, they, to my surprise, all had the same feeling.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A few even sang several of the commercials songs.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A few years ago, when advertisements began to appear in the Chinese media, most people, including myself, were against the practice.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some sighed: "The socialist TV, newspapers have started imitating the Western bourgeois media too!"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What has changed the audience's mentality in only several years' time?</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> First, Chinese advertisements have improved their advertising techniques.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At the beginning, the language of advertisements was simple, the music insipid and the images coarse and crude.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Later, some better foreign advertisements came to Chinese TV and newspapers.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "Where there is a mountain, there is a road; where there is a road, there is a Toyota."</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The words of the Japanese advertisement publicizing the Toyota car are very absurd but impressive and easy to memorize.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Nestle coffee is tasty indeed."</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The American advertisement promoting the sale of the Nestle brand coffee has become a new household phrase in China.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Gradually, Chinese advertisements also have learned how to dress themselves up.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They have strange and humorous associations, charming, deep male voices, colourful images and songs that are pleasing to the ear and easy to learn.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For these reasons, the commercials for Santana cars, Fuda colour film and Orient beverages have successfully attracted a TV audience.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Second, life needs advertisements.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Everything in modern society is linked to information, while the main function of advertisements is to disseminate information on commodities, service, culture, employment, student enrollment and even marriage.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Of course, one can obtain such information by listening to hearsay and making on-the-spot investigation,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> but the information provided by advertisements in doubtless the most direct, comprehensive and detailed.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As society advances, people's demands have become more and more diversified, and the commodities and service provided by society have also become more and more diversified.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> On the other hand, as living tempo quickens, people have less leisure time.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If they want to spend time finding suitable commodities, service and employment opportunities, they have to rely on advertisements.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So, unconsciously, people have changed their hatred for advertisements to an acceptance and utilization of them.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But, due to certain conditions in China, the Chinese do not have a great need for advertisements for the time being.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> That is because Chinese economy is not highly developed, and the supply of many commodities falls short of consumers' demands.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So the more consumers see the advertisements, the angrier they become.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Second, people's living pace has not quickened to the extent that they have no time to go shopping leisurely.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Many can even find time to walk the streets during their work hours.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There is no need for them to read "the shopping directory".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are even fewer people depending on advertisements to seek employment, for there is not much flow of the labour force.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Earlier this year, I discovered that the annual business volume of a US advertising corporation was as high as $6 billion, more than 12 per cent of that of China's exports last year.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I was really taken aback to find that an advertisement corporation had developed to such an extent.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It is said that advertising is indispensable to the lives of people in developed countries.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Without exception, people read advertisements before going shopping or looking for jobs.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It is against this social background that advertising has developed so much in these countries.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> An idea comes to me: As the economy develops, advertisements may finally penetrate every corner of our life.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The day will come when all Chinese will realize that advertising is essential to all of us.</T>
