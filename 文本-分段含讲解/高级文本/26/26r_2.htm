&nbsp; &nbsp;      Ted Kramer is a rising young executive in an advertising firm. He has just been promoted to a new responsible post and a brilliant career is before him. When he comes home with the happy news, his wife Joanna announces her decision to leave him. At first he doesn't take her seriously, thinking it was just a passing mood. He just can't imagine why she should want to abandon a comfortable life (he brings in good money) and a happy family (they have a lovely boy). In all fairness he has never ill-treated her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But to Joanna her married life has been an utter failure - meaningless and empty. With a college degree, she can make something more of her life than just to be someone's wife. She wants to live a worthwhile life of her own. It's not until the elevator's doors close in his face that Ted realizes that Joanna has gone out of his life. Despite long years of married life, he has never bothered to get to know, understand and sympathize with his wife until it is too late.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ted is left with their seven-year-old son Billy whom he hardly knows. Now he has to be both father and mother to his son, as well as to cope with his demanding work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     At first nothing goes well. Father and son fight each other. Ted's work suffers visibly, much to the worry of his superior. But as father and son are together more and more, their relation improves and their mutual dependence grows. Ted is discovering a human relationship which brings him new-formed love and happiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Fifteen months later Joanna reappears. Having gone through a therapy she has overcome her sense of failure. She has now a good job and wants to live a fuller life. She wants the custody of Billy. Ted angrily refuses her request and engages a lawyer to fight the case in court. To add to his trouble, he loses his job just at this time because of his neglect of work on account of his parental duties. He is told by his lawyer that without a job he has no chance of keeping the custody of his son. To keep Billy at any cost, he takes up a much lower-paid job, though his new boss tells him that with his qualifications and talents, he could get a much better job if he waited a little longer. But he cannot afford to wait.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In court ugly charges are brought up by the two lawyers to prove the unfitness of the opposite party as an unfit parent. Ted is described as a man who cannot keep his job and as a very negligent father. Joanna is described as a very irresponsible and unstable woman who needed therapy treatment. But in the end Joanna is awarded the custody of the boy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Feeling lost, bewildered and miserable, Ted makes preparations to hand over his son. Billy too has come to love his father and feels just as sad and bewildered at the prospect of leaving his father. Finally, at the fatal hour, Joanna turns up, not to take Billy away, but to announce her decision to give up her claim to the custody of her son. She has come to realize how much father and son now mean to each other and she has no heart to upset their lives again. In sorrow and in tears all she asks for is a last meeting with her son before she goes out of their lives forever.<BR>
