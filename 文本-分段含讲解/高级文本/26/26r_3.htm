<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Problems Arising from Living Apart</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      The Chinese household registration system forbids permanent dwelling without legal registration with the local public security units. Yet many people leave their hometowns ¡ª bringing with them their residence cards ¡ª to get further education or to join the army, or because they are transferred to jobs in other places.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The separation of married couples thereby occurs, and it has become a growing concern in China for the various problems it causes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Separation can lead to family crisis or divorce. Just as a society as a whole requires solidity, a family demands unity and stability. But this is exactly what separated couples lack ¡ª as well as the happiness that comes from living together. As a result, some couples end up permanently separated and divorced, as emotional ties between husband and wife erode.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The damage is not confined to the couples alone. The absence of normal family life can leave the children ill-educated and the aged uncared for, which can contribute to the instability of the whole society.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     For those living apart (an estimation of 6 million), the government grants one month paid home leave every year to one spouse. This equals more than 10 million lost work days, the equivalent of 300,000 people not working at all each year. In addition to the travel expenses, this costs the government a total of 2.2 billion <I>yuan</I> a year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Moreover, these "travellers" add to congestion in the already overloaded public transportation system.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     To end the misery of living apart, some couples seek solutions by "back-door" means, by inviting officials to parties or presenting them with gifts. While some succeed, most couples meet with frustration. Of the ones who succeed, some fail to find new jobs that match their skills and specialties.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     <T TYPE=HOT>Unremitting</T> efforts have been made by the government to ease the problems arising from living apart. Yet, they cannot be solved completely. There are several reasons for this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     One obstacle involves job transfers. Most work units are unwilling to accept administrative personnel, and they do not wish to hand over the valuable members of their staff to other units. In addition, most separated spouses who live in large cities dislike moving to small cities or to the countryside, and southerners do not want to go to the north.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     For another thing, some enterprises have become highly money oriented, demanding steep compensation for training fees from those who want to quit their jobs. In 1988, 300 to 700 <I>yuan</I> was demanded, but this fee has risen to 1,000 to 7,000 <I>yuan</I> this year. Similarly, the fee for those who apply for a new post grew from between 1,000 and 5,000 <I>yuan</I> last year to between 7,000 and 13,000 <I>yuan</I> early this year, and in some large cities, the fee runs as high as 40,000 <I>yuan.</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Job mobility should be encouraged and special consultations should be held for the purpose of exchanging employees in different parts of the country. Meanwhile, granting job transfers should not be treated as a good profit-making deal, and people who offer or accept bribes should be penalized.<BR>
