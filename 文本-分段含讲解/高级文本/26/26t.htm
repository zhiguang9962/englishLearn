<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Divorce used to be very rare in our country.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In old times it was not necessary for a man to divorce his wife as he could easily marry another or many others.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But women were expected to suffer in silence, and for those who could not, suicide was the only way out.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Despite the new marriage laws after Liberation, women still found the feudal conventions too strong for them to break away from.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The film The Well drove home this point only too well.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> It's only in the past decade, ever since our opening up to the outside world, that things are really beginning to change.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The following story, dramatic as it sounds, is a true and far from unique story of our times.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Thirty-year-old Xia Yafang used to work in a research institute in Shanghai.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Like most young people of her age her ambition was to go abroad and somehow she managed to land herself in Japan.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She started to work as a casual labourer in a tourist company in Tokyo.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Because of her industry and exceptional ability, and also partly due to chance, she worked herself up to the position of assistant-manager.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A brilliant career lay ahead of her and her future looked ever so bright.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When all seemed to be plain sailing Xiao Xia suddenly lost her peace of mind when she found the admiring eyes of the manager constantly fixed on her.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The message the eyes sent out was too obvious to be mistaken.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She read in them admiration, love and desire.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She could not remain unmoved, but she was caught in a dilemma.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She had a husband at home and also a little son.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So when the manager formally proposed to her she naturally told him that the whole thing was impossible as she already had a happy little family.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But nothing could put the manager off.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So deep was his love for her.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He pressed his suit and wanted her to divorce her husband and marry him instead.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If she had been a single woman she would have accepted him without any hesitation.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now she did not know what to do.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The manager gave her a fortnight's leave to go home and talk things over with her husband.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> If he agreed to let his wife go, the manager would pay him a substantial sum as compensation, and also make arrangement for their son to be brought up and settle in Japan.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When she stepped down from her plane at the airport in Shanghai, she immediately spotted her husband with their child in his arm waiting in the crowd.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When she saw him pushing his way through the crowd towards her, tears welled up in her eyes and she started to sob uncontrollably.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In the days that followed, she was overwhelmed by her husband's loving care and tenderness.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She just could not bring herself to talk about a divorce.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the end she left Shanghai without mentioning a word about her manager and his offer.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> But that was not the end of the affair.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The manager just would not give her up.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He decided to come to Shanghai in person and talk to her husband direct.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For the first three days he behaved as if there was nothing between him and Xiao Xia.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He let the couple take him around in Shanghai, having a nice time like any other tourist.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the process he managed to win the husband's friendship and trust.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Then on the third night he invited the husband to his room in his hotel alone.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There he put the whole thing to him openly and frankly, disguising nothing.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The shock for the husband can well be imagined.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He went home to his wife in a dazed state of mind.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He didn't mention a word to his wife about his conversation with her manager.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was no need to.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She didn't say anything either.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She just gave him time to sort things out for himself.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When the initial shock was over, he started to do some clear thinking and cool calculation.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His wife no longer loved him, at least not undividedly as before.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Even if he should forcibly keep her, the shadow of the manager would always stand between them.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She would have a much better future with the manager who could offer her much more than he could ever hope to offer.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And their son, too, would have a much better future in that fabulously rich land.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Yes, he must admit it, he was thinking for himself too.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The "compensation" the manager offered him was an astronomical figure.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> With it he could say good-bye to poverty for ever.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He could even buy a luxury apartment, a car, and find a beautiful young wife ...</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And so his feeling of loss, his wounded pride gave way to a new found equilibrium.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> After the necessary procedure of a divorce and her arrangements and application for another marriage, he saw his former wife and her future husband to the airport.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> What went through his mind as he watched their retreating figures walking towards the plane?</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Xiao Xia's story was carried in Shanghai Legal World.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> While refraining from moralizing himself, the writer asks the readers to draw their own moral and ethical conclusions.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> I know many similar cases involving people close to me.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In fact I had to act as the legal representative for one.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The woman in the office that handled the case told me that such divorce cases (involving one party that has gone abroad) are very common.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So long as no questions of property or care of children are involved, divorces are granted without any questions asked.</T>
