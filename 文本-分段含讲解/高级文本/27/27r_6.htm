<P ALIGN=center><B>6. The Fulfillment of One's Dreams</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      It's only natural to look forward to something better. We do it all our lives. Things may never really improve, but at least we always hope they will. It is one of life's great ironies that the longer we live, the less there is to look forward to. Retirement may bring with it the fulfillment of a lifetime's dreams. At last there will be time to do all the things we never had time for. From then on, the dream fades. Unless circumstances are exceptional, the prospect of growing really old is horrifying. Who wants to live long enough to become a <T TYPE=HOT>doddering</T> wreck? Who wants to revert to that most dreaded of all human conditions, a second childhood?<BR>
