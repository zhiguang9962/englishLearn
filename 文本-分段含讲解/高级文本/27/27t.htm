<P align=center><B><T TYPE=SEN>The Prospect of Growing Old Is Horrifying</T></B></P><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My father has an organic brain disease.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's Parkinson's disease, and in his case it has led to the additional trauma of Parkinsonian dementia.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is in and out of reality.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At times, he is as clever as can be ¡ª until he sees snakes or space stations or trucks in his room.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My mother and I together could no longer handle him at home.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He required physical assistance for every move and his behavior became too unpredictable.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> At home, he never slept and neither did we.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He also suffers from a narrowing of his spinal column, which pinches the nerves in his back and leaves him unable to find a painless position in bed.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We brought him to the hospital, where he stayed for seven weeks, until its utilization review board decided he no longer needed hospital care.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They kicked him out.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We put him in a nursing home, recommended as top of the line, with one nursing aide for every 15 patients (if everyone shows up for work).</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My father cannot feed himself nor get to and from the bathroom.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One nurse's aide with 15 patients cannot attend to his needs.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> So my mother spends seven to eight hours each day at the nursing home.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My father cries, yells and does all he knows to keep her there.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He thinks he is home and can't understand why she leaves him each evening.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He thinks she has other men.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He tells her she is boring a hole in his heart.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She cries.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The nursing home costs $45000 per year.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My father is lucky: Unlike most Americans, he has a decent union pension.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But his pension, added to his Social Security payment, puts him over the income eligibility level for Medicaid in Florida.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Not only is he disqualified from receiving Medicaid itself, his insurance only pays for claims certified by Medicaid.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> None of the diseases afflicting my father are fatal.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He is 69 years old, and both his parents lived to be 90.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> My family could be spending $45000 a year for the next 20 years.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> It's money we don't have.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> My mother is heartsick.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They worked and saved and bought insurance all their lives so that they could grow old in peace.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now she doesn't know how she will live, let alone how to take care of him.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A lawyer suggested to my mother that she divorce my father.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Yet she is the one who feeds him, cleans him and loves him.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Now, after 48 years of marriage, she is being counseled to divorce him so she can keep some funds back from the nursing home.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> We think about canceling his pension, but then neither of them would have any income.</T>
