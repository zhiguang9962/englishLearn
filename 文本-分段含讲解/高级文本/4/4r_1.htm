<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Unfair Criticism</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Stuart is a typical sixteen-year-old boy who experienced and suffered from the criticism of an alcoholic parent. It seemed to Stuart the only thing his father ever had to say to him was, "You haven't got a brain in your head." Stuart was a <T TYPE=HOT>sophomore</T> in high school. It was true he was a poor student, or what his dean called an "<T TYPE=HOT>underachiever</T>". Even though Stuart knew he was an underachiever, he would have liked to hear his father say, just once, something else when he brought home his report card other than his usual, "You haven't got a brain in your head."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Stuart was determined to prove to his father he did have a brain in his head. Stuart studied very hard. Some nights it was difficult for him to concentrate on his homework because he could hear his parents <T TYPE=HOT>bickering</T> in the next room.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "You forgot to pay the <T TYPE=HOT>mortgage</T> again. The bank is fed up."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "How many times can a person smash up a car? I'm surprised they haven't taken your license away!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "If you wouldn't drink so much ..."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Stuart didn't like the bickering, and wondered if his parents might separate. He wondered, too, because his father was so forgetful about paying the bills, if they might lose their home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     He kept telling himself that if he studied hard, maybe, by some miracle, things would get better at home. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Stuart's determination to concentrate on his school work, in spite of the bickering and worries at home, paid off. His next report card showed a marked improvement. There was even a personal note of praise from his dean written on the report card.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Proudly Stuart put the report card on his father's desk. Stuart felt happier than he had felt in a long time. He knew that his father could only be pleased with such a report, but more important, maybe now his father would realize that he was intelligent and would start paying some attention to him. Stuart could remember when his father used to go to ballgames and movies with him. Who knew? Maybe things would go back to the way they used to be. Stuart would offer to get a part-time job to help pay off some of the bills. He thought that might lessen some of the arguing at home and keep the family from breaking up. He would let his father know that he was old enough to understand things weren't always easy at the office.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     When Stuart's father came home and saw the report, he said without any hesitation, "Well, well, who did the work for you? I know you don't have the brains to do it!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Stuart was stunned. All that work for nothing! He wouldn't be surprised if his father not only thought he was stupid but hated him, too.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Stuart would not have been as hurt if he had only known his father was tied up in his own miserable feelings. This kept him from recognizing what Stuart had accomplished in school.<BR>
