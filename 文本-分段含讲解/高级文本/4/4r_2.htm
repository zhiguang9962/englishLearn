<P ALIGN=center><B>2. Uses of Criticism</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     While some of us have a tendency to disbelieve or to minimize the good things people say about us, others among us have a tendency to hold a protective web around ourselves in defense against criticism. One workshop participant said, "I confuse the issue by getting logical in the face of threatening reactions. Sometimes I act helpless so others will stop the criticism." Early in the workshop experience he had received more negative than positive reactions. While he was fearful of criticism, he found that he had courted it, hoping that he could learn how to handle it and overcome his fear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     We may court negative reactions for other reasons. A therapy group member regarded criticism as more useful than compliments, and criticism is what he often got - not because he asked for it directly, but because of his detached manner, as though he were sitting in judgment of others. Moreover, his tendency to qualify and hedge his opinions and feelings until they had no meaning often brought down the ire of others upon him. He gave the impression of accepting their displeasure stoically, as though it strengthened him. He never openly criticized other members, however.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Still another member, who claimed that "criticism is the stuff that we grow on", gave others criticism galore so they could improve and, in his words, "not appear in a negative light in the future." This member came across as using his <T TYPE=HOT>ostensible</T> concern for the growth of others as an excuse to criticize and attack them.<BR>
