<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Is It Right to Withhold One's Reactions to Others?</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It is not uncommon for us to withhold our reactions to others. We may hold back compliments for fear of embarrassment to them and to ourselves. We may hold back criticism for fear of being disliked or considered unfair, or for fear of hurting another person. Reactions given inconsiderately may indeed hurt others. On the other hand, some of us are inclined to withhold our reactions from others while at the same time we honestly prefer that they not hold back theirs from us. We may have two different rules. The first one may be: If we ask others for <T TYPE=HOT>candid</T> reactions to our behavior, to something we have done or plan to do, we want them to tell us straight, including the negative with the positive. The second rule may be: If someone else asks us for similar reactions, we are inclined to hold back or <T TYPE=HOT>gloss over</T> the negative and <T TYPE=HOT>embroider</T> the positive.<BR>
