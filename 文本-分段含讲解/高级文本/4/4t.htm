<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Marya, a brilliant graduate student in her early twenties who came for consultation, insisted that she could improve only with criticism.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Her reasoning was that she knew the good qualities but that she did not know the bad ones.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> To have more knowledge of her negative qualities, she believed, would add to her self-understanding and thus enable her to see herself more completely.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Marya, in effect, refused to acknowledge and to understand her strengths.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She had assembled detailed lists of her negative qualities which she used daily to support an extremely negative view of herself.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But they were either exaggerated or unreal.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Despite her attractiveness to others, she convinced herself that she was ugly.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When her family bought her new and well-designed articles of clothing (she seldom bought any herself), she left them hanging in the closet for weeks before wearing them once.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> When someone complimented her on what she wore and asked whether it was new, she could honestly answer no.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She did not "deserve" to wear new clothes.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She could not bear the pain of hearing compliments, of seeing herself as intelligent, pretty, or worthwhile.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> As a child, Marya had received little or no criticism from her parents.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She was prized by them.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Their major disappointment in her apparently was that she often rejected their overtures of kindness and appreciation, not in anger but in embarrassment, as though she were undeserving.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This seemingly mild-mannered young woman, exceptionally courteous and considerate to others, held onto her own negative self-judgment with tenacity.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Finally, friends and interested faculty members quit acceding to her persuasive requests for criticism that they could not honestly give.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Instead, they gently but firmly confronted her with her own blindness to what she truly was like.</T>
