&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> More and more high school students in Beijing are turning their minds to ways of making money.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> They are capitalizing on opportunities such as one group of students who went to the front gate of the Children's Centre in the East District of Beijing when a film studio was there conducting auditions.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The group sold the young hopefuls application forms at five fen a piece after getting the forms from the centre for free.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Young entrepreneurs are also capitalizing on high demand commodities not always available away from the big shopping centres.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Birthday or greeting cards are an example.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> One department store estimated that 80 per cent of its sales of cards are to students for resale.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Xiao Li, a junior high school student at Fengtai District in the southwest region of the capital, spent 40 yuan buying cards from downtown shops just before the last Spring Festival.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> She sold them at her school and schools nearby at prices 15 to 20 per cent higher than what she had paid.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In a month, she earned 100 yuan, representing a 250 per cent return on her initial investment.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A senior high school student who had been selling cards has now become an amateur wholesale dealer.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His wholesale price is 8 per cent higher than his purchasing price and 10 per cent lower than the retail price.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Within two months, he had earned several hundred yuan in profits.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Many students have merged their activities to avoid price wars.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For example, in an area with few State-owned shops and far from the city centre, student union heads from the schools there have reached an agreement on card prices.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The agreement says prices may be higher than at the downtown shops but lower than at the peddlers' stalls.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Card-selling is just a beginning.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Some students turn their eyes to other more profitable ventures.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Take one senior high school sophomore who has developed a flourishing business selling photos of famous people.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He even has his own name card that reads: The High School Student Corporation Ltd of Exploitation of New Technology.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The student carries a portfolio of the photos around with him in an album to show his young customers.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He offers a wide variety of photos, from American movie star Sylvester Stallone in Rambo pose to Taiwan's famous singer Qi Qin.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "These all depend on my high quality camera," he boasts and explains how he clipped the pictures from magazines, photographed them and then developed the prints into various sizes.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He has sold hundreds.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Another student is now an amateur salesman for a company and earns a three per cent commission on each sale.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> When he had earned 300 yuan through his own efforts, he said, "I feel that I have really become an adult."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Most of the money the students earn is spent on themselves.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They can buy high-priced items like a pair of running shoes which can cost as much as 100 yuan ¡ª a month's salary for an average worker.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Few parents can afford such luxuries.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some students find work to help them realize their dreams of a career.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Qian Qian wants to become an actress.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In her spare time she attends a class outside school that costs 80 yuan a month in tuition, an amount which her parents cannot afford to pay.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So she found a job as a waitress in a coffee house to earn her tuition fee.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Some students get into business for other reasons besides the money.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Zou Yue, a female student, from a fairly wealthy family, took a job because, she said,</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "Business can cultivate a sense of competition, which is very important for us in the future."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A student who once sold cards said young people are encouraged to be independent.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "But how?" he asked.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "You can never be independent unless you can support yourself financially."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> He felt after-school work enhanced a young person's social development, too.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Practical experience in the workforce has been stipulated by the State Commission of Education as a compulsory programme.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This is now closely related with economic benefits among high school students.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One student, sent by her school to work as a shop assistant at a temple fair, earned five yuan a day for a seven-hour shift behind the counter.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I had a sore throat after working for a few days, but I had to hold on," she said.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> "I wanted to earn the money and also prove that I was an able girl."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> These temporary job stints give high school students an insight into what work and incomes are all about.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> A job at a State-owned cinema may only earn a worker 40 or 50 yuan a month.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But a job with a self-employed trader, may earn the assistant 8 or 10 yuan a day.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A writer may get about 20 yuan for an article in a newspaper or a magazine, but a clothes keeper in a swimming pool may earn at least 200 yuan a month.</T>
