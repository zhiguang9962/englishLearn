<P ALIGN=center><B>5. Legal System Should Be Established to Deal with Euthanasia</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Many countries have legalized mercy killing. In Uruguay the law states that, "The judges are authorized to <T TYPE=HOT>forgo</T> punishment of a person whose life has been honorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion induced by repeated requests by the victim." Switzerland, Norway, and Germany have adopted similar approaches.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     American law appears in need of revision. However, some feel that legalized euthanasia would invite abuse. Any form of murder might be conveniently <T TYPE=HOT>dubbed</T> "mercy killing" by <T TYPE=HOT>unscrupulous</T> persons. In response, some euthanasia proponents have suggested that our legal system establish an evaluation body to judge which requests for a mercy killing are valid before the act is committed.<BR>
