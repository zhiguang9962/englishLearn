<P ALIGN=center><B>6. Is There a Way to Compromise?</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Medical science is doing all it can to extend human life and is succeeding brilliantly. Living conditions are so much better, so many diseases can either be prevented or cured that life expectation has increased enormously. No one would deny that this is a good thing ¡ª provided one enjoys perfect health. But is it a good thing to extend human suffering, to prolong life, not in order to give joy and happiness, but to give pain and sorrow? Take an extreme example. Take the case of a man who is so senile he has lost all his faculties. He is in hospital in an unconscious state with little chance of coming round, but he is kept alive by artificial means for an indefinite period. Everyone, his friends, relatives and even the doctors agree that death will bring release. Indeed, the patient himself would agree ¡ª if he were in a position to give choice to his feelings. Yet everything is done to <T TYPE=HOT>perpetuate</T> what has become a meaningless existence. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The question of euthanasia raises serious moral issues, since it implies that active measures will be taken to terminate human life. And this is an exceedingly dangerous principle to allow. But might it not be possible to compromise? With regard to senility, it might be preferable to let nature take its course when death will relieve suffering. After all, this would be doing no more than was done in the past, before medical science made it possible to interfere with the course of nature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     There are people in Afghanistan and Russia who are reputed to live to a ripe old age. These exceptionally <T TYPE=HOT>robust</T> individuals are just getting into their stride at 70. Cases have been reported of men over 120 getting married and having children. Some of these people are said to be over 150 years old. Under such exceptional conditions, who wouldn't want to go on living forever? But in our societies, to be 70 usually means that you are old; to be 90 often means that you are <T TYPE=HOT>decrepit</T>. The instinct for self-preservation is the strongest we possess. We cling dearly to life while we have it and enjoy it. But there always comes a time when we'd be better off dead.<BR>
