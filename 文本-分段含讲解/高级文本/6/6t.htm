<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The most famous mercy killing case in America's history involves Dr. Herman N. Sanders, a country doctor from New Hampshire.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In the early 1950s Dr. Sanders had been treating a sixty-year-old woman in Hillsboro County Hospital who was dying of cancer.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The woman had wasted away from 140 pounds to 80 pounds.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There was no chance for recovery and she suffered extreme pain.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Often she screamed out in anguish from her bed.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> She begged everyone who came near her to help her die.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Toward the end there was little Dr. Sanders could do medically to ease his patient's suffering.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He knew that her last days would be torturously painful.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So he decided to put an end to her misery.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dr. Sanders gave his patient four lethal injections of air, which caused her to die painlessly in under ten minutes.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He recorded his action on the hospital's record and said no more of the matter.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> However, hospital administrators came across Dr. Sanders' entry when reviewing the records at a staff meeting and reported it to the state.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> A warrant for the doctor's arrest was issued and served by the sheriff.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The warrant charged that Dr. Sanders "feloniously and willfully and of his own malice and aforethought did inject ... air into the veins of Abbie Borroto</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and with said injection, feloniously and willfully and of his said malice aforethought killed and murdered his patient".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The doctor pleaded not guilty and was released on $25000 bail.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Dr. Sanders had been a known and respected member of his community for many years.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He was born in New Hampshire, where his father had been an official of the Public Service Corporation of New Hampshire.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In college, Dr. Sanders had been captain of the Dartmouth ski team as well as a member of the college symphony orchestra.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He had recently returned from Europe where he had continued his study of medicine.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Until the time of the mercy killing, his reputation was excellent.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Dr. Sanders had been considered a trusted and honored physician.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> In response to the charges hurled against him, Dr. Sanders claimed that he had done no wrong.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The woman had been within hours of her death.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Moved by pity, he had merely hastened an extremely brutal end.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> The Sunday after his arrest, Dr. Sanders and his family attended services at their church as usual.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His minister and other clergymembers across the state openly expressed their support.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> One minister in a nearby town preached a stirring sermon in Dr. Sanders' defense.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> He said that if the doctor was guilty, he was guilty too.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> For he had often prayed that some suffering parishioner might be "eased into the experience of death".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Later that day 605 of the 650 registered voters in his town presented Dr. Sanders with a written testimonial to his integrity and goodwill.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They told him to use it wherever it might help him to prove his innocence.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> However, their efforts did little good.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The attorney-general of New Hampshire firmly stated that "the case will be presented forcefully and in complete detail, regardless of the personalities involved, to the end that justice may be met".</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> In response, hundreds of Dr. Sanders' fellow townspeople offered to testify on his behalf.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> They signed petitions urging the courts to dismiss the case.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Nevertheless, a grand jury indicted him for first-degree murder.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> "All I can say," stated Sanders, "is that I am not guilty of any legal or moral wrong and ultimately my position will be vindicated."</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Not long afterward, Dr. Sanders was acquitted.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But even after he was declared innocent, some were intent on punishing the doctor.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> His license to practise medicine was suspended.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And while some clergymembers had supported Dr. Sanders, others loudly condemned him from their pulpits.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Among them was the Reverend Billy Graham, who stated in Boston that "Dr. Sanders should be punished as an example"</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> and that "anyone who voluntarily, knowingly or premeditatedly takes the life of another, even one minute prior to death, is a killer".</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> While Dr. Sanders was not permitted to practise medicine, he supported himself and his family by working as a farm hand.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Finally the Medical Board of the State of New Hampshire reinstated his license.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And Dr. Sanders has continued as a doctor in his hometown ever since.</T>
