John: Examinations do more harm than good!<BR>
Michael: I agree. We spend so much time revising for examinations that we haven't enough time for new work!<BR>
Joan: I don't agree. Without exams, no one would do any revision. We would soon forget everything.<BR>
Linda: That's right. The only time I do any work is when there's going to be an exam! That's true of everyone, isn't it?<BR>
John: No, I don't think so. Many people work steadily all the time, and they remember what they learn. That's better than doing no work for weeks and then working all night before the examination. If there were no exams, more people would work like that, don't you agree?<BR>
Joan: No, I don't think so. I think many people wouldn't do any work at all. I know I wouldn't.<BR>
Linda: Of course not. Besides, without exams, how could an employer decide whether to give us jobs?<BR>
John: The teachers could write reports about us. Examinations can be unreliable, don't you think so? Our teachers know as well, don't they?<BR>
Linda: Yes, they do. That's why I would rather have an examination!<BR>
