<P ALIGN=center><B>3. Homework Row Led to the Death of a Girl</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     A nine-year-old girl was beaten to death by her mother for failing to finish the day's homework in time. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Liu Lin was a third-year pupil in a primary school in a Tibetan <T TYPE=HOT>autonomous</T> prefecture in Northwest Qinghai Province. She was one of the best students in her school, according to yesterday's Workers' Daily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     But on July 10, she did not do her arithmetic homework when Sun Fengxia, her mother, got home from work at 4:00 p.m.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Sun severely beat her daughter with a rolling pin, the newspaper said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     By 7:30 p.m. that evening, she found that her daughter had done only part of the homework, and she became even more angry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Sun slapped her daughter in the face and kicked her, according to the paper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Lin became unconscious and later died despite efforts of doctors to save her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Such cases are not rare in China. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In December last year in the province, Wu Yuxia beat her nine-year-old son Xia Fei to death. She later committed suicide in a prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Dalian of Northeast Liaoning Province, Li Liansheng beat his 14-year-old son Li Guobin to death in March last year because the boy was playing truant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In Nanjing, capital of coastal Jiangsu Province, 19-year-old Wang Lin killed his parents at home because they forced him to try to get good marks in examinations.<BR>
