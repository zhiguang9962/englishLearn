<P ALIGN=center><B>3. High-fat Diet, Little Strength</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     You bring one of our football players in and put them on a stationary exercise bicycle and tell them to work as hard as they can for as long as they can, and you'll time them. Say the guy lasts for eight minutes, and then he's just exhausted. Then for three days you put him on a high-fat diet. He comes back in, goes on the bike and he'll last probably only six minutes. He's lost that much strength.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Then put him on a high carbohydrate, low-fat diet for only three days, and he'll probably go up to 12 minutes. It makes that much difference.<BR>
