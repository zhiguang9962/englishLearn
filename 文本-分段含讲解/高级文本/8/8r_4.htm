<P ALIGN=center><B>4. I Feel Great Because I've Lost All That Extra Weight!</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     During my first year of college, I gained forty pounds when I began throwing the javelin. For the next twenty years, I carried all of this extra weight and kidded myself that I was in good shape since that's what I weighed in college. Now that I've lost all that extra weight, I feel great!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     People say all the time, "Well, how do you live without eating cheeseburgers or this or that?" and I say, "You just don't. It's not even an option." It's not that hard once you get on it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The most difficult parts for me are the social aspects of eating. For example, hamburgers were hard to do without at first because I identified eating them with fun times - sitting on the floor with the kids watching television, or in a fun place with people sitting around laughing, drinking beer and eating burgers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     It's the same at a <T TYPE=HOT>tailgate picnic</T> at a football game. It was hard - not because of the foods there, but because of the social factors. But once you understand that, then you can say, "I can enjoy the social part without having to eat that food." It's more what you're doing than the food itself.<BR>
