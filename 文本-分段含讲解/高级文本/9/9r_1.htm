<P ALIGN=center><B>1. Childless ¡ª and Happy That Way</B></P><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     In a country where most people believe that a family is not a family without children, some young couples, especially those with a higher education, have chosen to keep their families to two members ¡ª husband and wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I can't afford to have a child," said Wang, a promising research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Wang has been busy travelling abroad and has received scholarship offers from a number of American universities that would enable him to complete his PhD.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "He is a free bird who may leave the nest any day and I've never cared much about a child," said Xiao Wei, Wang's wife, business representative of a French company in Beijing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Unlike the Wangs, Zhang and his wife have argued over whether they should have a baby.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "When we were married six years ago, we decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude on the issue. And after a couple of years, my wife said she wanted to have a baby while I insisted we were just fine without one. We have been arguing about the matter ever since, and now that we are over 30, I think we're likely to end up in accordance with my wishes," said Zhang.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "There are many marriages that should have long been broken. People just hold on because a divorce would hurt the children most and the parents hate to face that prospect. So the couple sticks together and winds up torturing each other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "A real happy family is a family that, without children, is still a happy family," said Zhang.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ma Jiang, who has opened a trading company and was instantly nicknamed Money Bags by his friends, said he would hate to be bothered with a child.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "To me, being without a child, I am less bound by household chores and can concentrate on my business. My lovely wife is all I need, no third person," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Ma's wife, Xiao Lu, working for a government unit, could have quit her job and become dependent on her "rich" husband. But she decided against it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "I can't imagine what I would be like if I stayed at home, doing household chores and breast-feeding a child. I'd rather keep my independence at all costs," she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Whatever people say, I believe that to have a child means a lot of sacrifice. We're just not ready for that, fun or misery," Ma's wife said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Hou Mingkun and his wife Luo Qian said they weren't against having a child, boy or girl, if only the baby was physically well developed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "One takes a risk when having a baby. I've heard too many stories about children born with physical defects. Since there's no guarantee that the same won't happen to my baby, I think I'd better not get myself involved. People say¡®no pain, no gain,' but for me it's no gain, no pain," Luo said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     The couple were classmates in high school and went to the same university in Shanghai. Now, they are working for a computer company in Beijing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Those who choose not to have children have to overcome some unexpected difficulties in defending their <T TYPE=HOT>stance</T>.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Influenced by the traditional view that one's worst sin is having no descendants, most people still accept that a wife is not a good wife if she doesn't have a child.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     Though few Chinese believe in an after-life, they do care a lot about growing old. For centuries, one of the purposes of having children, sons especially, was to have someone take care of the parents when they were old.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "Now, since both husband and wife are working, they will have a pension when they retire. What happens now is that the retired parents are supporting their adult children," Wang said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     "We're normal people, just like everyone else, We've just chosen to live our own way which harms no one. I hope people understand us," Wang said.<BR>
