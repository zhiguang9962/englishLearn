&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> We moved slowly through the city in a taxi and entered a crowded slum district.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The temperature was well over 100¡ãand the air was thick with dust and smoke.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> The streets seemed alive with people.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People eating, people washing, people sleeping.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People visiting each other, arguing and screaming.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People pushing their hands through the taxi windows, begging.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People relieving themselves.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People holding on to the sides of buses.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People leading animals.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> People, people, people, people.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As we drove slowly through the crowd, sounding the taxi's horn, the dust, heat, noise and cooking fires made it like a scene from Hell.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Would we ever get to our hotel?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> All three of us were, I admit, frightened.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Since that night, I've known what overpopulation feels like.</T><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <T TYPE=SEN> Statistics show that rapid population growth creates problems for developing countries.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So why don't people have fewer children?</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Statistics from the developed countries suggest that it is only when people's living standards begin to rise that birth rates begin to fall.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> There are good reasons for this.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Poor countries cannot afford social services and old age pensions, and people's incomes are so low they have nothing to spare for savings.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> As a result, people look to their children to provide them with security in their old age.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> Having a large family can be a form of insurance.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> And even while they are still quite young, children can do a lot of useful jobs on a small farm.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> So poor people in a developing country will need to see clear signs of much better conditions ahead before they will think of having smaller families.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> But their conditions cannot be improved unless there is a reduction in the rate at which population is increasing.</T>
<T TYPE=SEN> This will depend on a very much wider acceptance of family planning and this, in turn, will mean basic changes in attitudes.</T>
